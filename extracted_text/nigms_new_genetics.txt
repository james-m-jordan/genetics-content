 of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains one base,
 one phosphate molecule, and the sugar molecule
 deoxyribose. The bases in DNA nucleotides are
 adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.

         Many years after the structure of DNA
      was determined, researchers used a powerful
      device known as an electron microscope to
      take pictures of chromatin fibers. Upon
      viewing chromatin up close, the researchers
      described it as “beads on a string,” an image
      still used today. The beads were the histone
      balls, and the string was DNA wrapped
      around the histones and connecting one
      bead to the next.
         Decades of study eventually revealed that
      histones have special chemical tags that act
      like switches to control access to the DNA.
      Flipping these switches, called epigenetic
      markings, unwinds the spooled DNA so the

      genes can be transcribed.

      machinery tracks epigenetic markings led

      mitochondria are thought to have descended
      from free-living bacteria that were engulfed by
      another cell over a billion years ago.

      aged mitochondria are a symptom or a cause of
      these health conditions.
         Scientists have studied mitochondrial DNA
      for another reason: to understand the history of
      the human race. Unlike our chromosomal DNA,
      which we inherit from both parents, we get all of
      our mitochondrial DNA from our mothers.                                                              A computerized overlay

                  The millions of different living things on
              Earth—plants, bacteria, insects, chimps, people,
              and everything else—all came to be because of
              a process called biological evolution, in which
              organisms change over time.                                      Time

                  Because of biological evolution, early humans
              gained the ability to walk on two feet. Because of
              evolution, air-breathing whales can live in the
              ocean despite being mammals like us. Because of
              evolution, some bacteria can live in scalding water,
              others can survive in solid ice, and still others can
              live deep in the Earth eating only rocks!
                  Evolution happens every day, and it affects
              every species—including us. It changes entire
              populations, not individuals. And it has a big
              impact on medical research.


              Everything Evolves
              To understand evolution, let’s go back in time a
              century and a half to 1854, when the British
              naturalist Charles Darwin published The Origin

genes shape who we are and what we become?

warned against oversimplifying the role of genes

agricultural biotechnology’s future. Some object
to the development of plants that are naturally

Careers in Genetics
Opportunities to be part of genetic and
genomic research have never been greater or
more exciting. In addition to studying human
genes, scientists are gathering information
about the genes of many other living things,
from microbes that cause disease to model
organisms like mice and Drosophila, livestock,
and crop plants.
   Although computers do some of the work,
this avalanche of information has to be analyzed
by thousands and thousands of human brains.
