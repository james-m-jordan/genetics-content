About Biology
Biology is designed to cover the scope and sequence requirements of a
typical two-semester biology course for science majors. The text provides
comprehensive coverage of foundational research and core biology
concepts through an evolutionary lens. Biology includes rich features that
engage students in scientific inquiry, highlight careers in the biological
sciences, and offer everyday applications. The book also includes clicker
questions to help students understand—and apply—key concepts.

Coverage and Scope
In developing Biology, we listened to hundreds of General Biology
instructors who readily provided feedback about their courses, students,
challenges, and hopes for innovation. The expense of textbooks and related
items did prove to be a barrier to learning. But more importantly, these
teachers suggested improvements for the textbook, which would ultimately
lead to more meaningful and memorable learning experiences for students.

The result is a book that addresses a core organizational reality of the
course and its materials—the sheer breadth of the topical coverage. We
provide a thorough treatment of biology’s foundational concepts while
condensing selected topics in response to the market’s request for a
textbook with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike.
We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to
students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and
foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into
the discipline in meaningful ways.

The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective
fulfillment were developed and vetted with the feedback of another one
hundred reviewers, who thoroughly read the material and offered detailed
critical commentary.

     Unit 1: The Chemistry of Life. Our opening unit introduces students
     to the sciences, including the scientific method and the fundamental
     concepts of chemistry and physics that provide a framework within
     which learners comprehend biological processes.
     Unit 2: The Cell. Students will gain solid understanding of the
     structures, functions, and processes of the most basic unit of life: the
     cell.
     Unit 3: Genetics. Our comprehensive genetics unit takes learners from
     the earliest experiments that revealed the basis of genetics through the
     intricacies of DNA to current applications in the emerging studies of
     biotechnology and genomics.

     discussed in this unit with examples illustrating evolutionary
     processes. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of biology reappears
     throughout the textbook in general discussion and is reinforced
     through special call-out features highlighting specific evolution-based
     topics.
     Unit 5: Biological Diversity. The diversity of life is explored with
     detailed study of various organisms and discussion of emerging
     phylogenetic relationships. This unit moves from viruses to living
     organisms like bacteria, discusses the organisms formerly grouped as
     protists, and devotes multiple chapters to plant and animal life.
     Unit 6: Plant Structure and Function. Our plant unit thoroughly
     covers the fundamental knowledge of plant life essential to an
     introductory biology course.
     Unit 7: Animal Structure and Function. An introduction to the form
     and function of the animal body is followed by chapters on specific
     body systems and processes. This unit touches on the biology of all
     organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy
     and physiology that helps students connect to the topics.
     Unit 8: Ecology. Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit,
     with features highlighting localized, real-world issues of conservation
     and biodiversity.

Genetics is the study of heredity. Johann Gregor Mendel set the framework
for genetics long before chromosomes or genes had been identified, at a
time when meiosis was not well understood. Mendel selected a simple
biological system and conducted methodical, quantitative analyses using
large sample sizes. Because of Mendel’s work, the fundamental principles
of heredity were revealed. We now know that genes, carried on
chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the capability
to be replicated, expressed, or mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by
Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Not all genes
are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics,
but Mendel’s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking
about inheritance.
Mendel’s Experiments and the Laws of Probability
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the scientific reasons for the success of Mendel’s experimental work
     Describe the expected outcomes of monohybrid crosses involving dominant and
     recessive alleles
     Apply the sum and product rules to calculate probabilities




  Johann Gregor Mendel is
   considered the father of
          genetics.



Johann Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) ([link]) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist,
and man of faith. As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in
Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the monastery, he taught
physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In
1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in
honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system (a
system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon
to be applied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his
experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local Natural History Society. He
demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring
independently of other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. In 1866, he
published his work, Experiments in Plant Hybridization,[footnote] in the proceedings of
the Natural History Society of Brünn.

naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn, Bd. IV für das Jahr, 1865 Abhandlungen, 3–47.

Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed,
incorrectly, that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that
produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this hypothetical process
appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation.
Continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a
characteristic like human height. Offspring appear to be a “blend” of their parents’
traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. The blending
theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by
the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case. Mendel was the
first researcher to see it. Instead of continuous characteristics, Mendel worked with
traits that were inherited in distinct classes (specifically, violet versus white flowers);
this is referred to as discontinuous variation. Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits
allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor
were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on.
In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits
for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific
contributions during his lifetime. In fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was
rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the
chromosomal basis of heredity.

Mendel’s Model System
Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, to
study inheritance. This species naturally self-fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova
within individual flowers. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until after
pollination, preventing pollination from other plants. The result is highly inbred, or
“true-breeding,” pea plants. These are plants that always produce offspring that look
like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the
appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true
breeding. The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that
several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large
quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to
conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance.

Mendelian Crosses
Mendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals
that have different traits. In the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by
manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the
stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. In plants, pollen carries the
male gametes (sperm) to the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the
sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below. To prevent the pea
plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results,
Mendel painstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plant’s flowers before they
had a chance to mature.

Plants used in first-generation crosses were called P0, or parental generation one, plants
([link]). Mendel collected the seeds belonging to the P0 plants that resulted from each
cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were called the F1, or the
first filial (filial = offspring, daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the
characteristics in the F1 generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally.
He then collected and grew the seeds from the F1 plants to produce the F2, or second
filial, generation. Mendel’s experiments extended beyond the F2 generation to the F3
and F4 generations, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P0−F1−F2
generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for Mendel’s postulates.
    In one of his experiments on
    inheritance patterns, Mendel
   crossed plants that were true-
  breeding for violet flower color
with plants true-breeding for white
  flower color (the P generation).
   The resulting hybrids in the F1
 generation all had violet flowers.
        In the F2 generation,
  approximately three quarters of
the plants had violet flowers, and
   one quarter had white flowers.
Garden Pea Characteristics Revealed the Basics of Heredity
In his 1865 publication, Mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven
different characteristics, each with two contrasting traits. A trait is defined as a
variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics
included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod
color, and flower position. For the characteristic of flower color, for example, the two
contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each characteristic, Mendel
generated large numbers of F1 and F2 plants, reporting results from 19,959 F2 plants
alone. His findings were consistent.

What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed
that he had plants that bred true for white or violet flower color. Regardless of how
many generations Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white
flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers
had violet flowers. In addition, Mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea
plants were physically identical.

Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with
violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers. After gathering and sowing
the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that 100 percent of the F1 hybrid
generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted
the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white
and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend
in the offspring. Instead, Mendel’s results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the
F1 generation had completely disappeared.

Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F1 plants to
self-fertilize and found that, of F2-generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had
white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white flower, or
approximately 3:1. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to
the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same
ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait. This is called
a reciprocal cross—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female
in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For
the other six characteristics Mendel examined, the F1 and F2 generations behaved in the
same way as they had for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear
completely from the F1 generation only to reappear in the F2 generation at a ratio of
approximately 3:1 ([link]).

Upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, Mendel concluded that the
characteristics could be divided into expressed and latent traits. He called these,
respectively, dominant and recessive traits. Dominant traits are those that are inherited
unchanged in a hybridization. Recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the
offspring of a hybridization. The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny
of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower trait. For
this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The
fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F2 generation meant that the traits
remained separate (not blended) in the plants of the F1 generation. Mendel also
proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic,
and that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came
together. Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the
genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the
characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely,
the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant
versions of this characteristic.

So why did Mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses? To understand how
Mendel deduced the basic mechanisms of inheritance that lead to such ratios, we must
first review the laws of probability.

Probability Basics
Probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. The empirical probability of an
event is calculated by dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total
number of opportunities for the event to occur. It is also possible to calculate theoretical
probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the
number of times that it could occur. Empirical probabilities come from observations,
like those of Mendel. Theoretical probabilities come from knowing how the events are
produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. A
probability of one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a
probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to occur. An example of a genetic
event is a round seed produced by a pea plant. In his experiment, Mendel demonstrated
that the probability of the event “round seed” occurring was one in the F1 offspring of
true-breeding parents, one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled
seeds. When the F1 plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of any given
F2 offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. In other words, in a large
population of F2 offspring chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round
seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds. Using large numbers
of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the
outcomes of other crosses.



The Product Rule and Sum Rule

Mendel demonstrated that the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as
discrete units from parent to offspring. As will be discussed, Mendel also determined
that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were transmitted
independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses.
For instance, performing a cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant
with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a 3:1 ratio of green:yellow
seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed
color). The characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other.

The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent
transmission of characteristics. The product rule states that the probability of two
independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual
probabilities of each event occurring alone. To demonstrate the product rule, imagine
that you are rolling a six-sided die (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time. The
die may roll any number from 1–6 (D#), whereas the penny may turn up heads (PH) or
tails (PT). The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the
penny and vice versa. There are 12 possible outcomes of this action ([link]), and each
event is expected to occur with equal probability.

Of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and
the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of coming up heads. By the product rule, the
probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (D2) x (PH) =
(1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12 ([link]). Notice the word “and” in the description of the probability.
The “and” is a signal to apply the product rule. For example, consider how the product
rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits in
the F2 progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each
characteristic, as shown here:
Equation:

                                  3     3           9
                                   /  ×  /      =    /
                                    4     4           16
On the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two
mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway. The sum
rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of two
mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word
“or” in the description of the probability. The “or” indicates that you should apply the
sum rule. In this case, let’s imagine you are flipping a penny (P) and a quarter (Q).
What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? This
outcome can be achieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (PH) and the quarter
may be tails (QT), or the quarter may be heads (QH) and the penny may be tails (PT).
Either case fulfills the outcome. By the sum rule, we calculate the probability of
obtaining one head and one tail as [(PH) × (QT)] + [(QH) × (PT)] = [(1/2) × (1/2)] +
[(1/2) × (1/2)] = 1/2 ([link]). You should also notice that we used the product rule to
calculate the probability of PH and QT, and also the probability of PT and QH, before we
summed them. Again, the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having
just one dominant trait in the F2 generation of a dihybrid cross:
Equation:

                                 3      3           15
                                  /   +  /      =     /

  The Product Rule and Sum Rule

  Product Rule                                 Sum Rule

  For independent events A and B, the          For mutually exclusive events A and
  probability (P) of them both                 B, the probability (P) that at least one
  occurring (A and B) is (PA × PB)             occurs (A or B) is (PA + PB)

To use probability laws in practice, it is necessary to work with large sample sizes
because small sample sizes are prone to deviations caused by chance. The large
quantities of pea plants that Mendel examined allowed him calculate the probabilities
of the traits appearing in his F2 generation. As you will learn, this discovery meant that
when parental traits were known, the offspring’s traits could be predicted accurately
even before fertilization.

Section Summary
Working with garden pea plants, Mendel found that crosses between parents that
differed by one trait produced F1 offspring that all expressed the traits of one parent.
Observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits are described as
recessive. When the offspring in Mendel’s experiment were self-crossed, the F2
offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming
that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original P0 parent.
Reciprocal crosses generated identical F1 and F2 offspring ratios. By examining sample
sizes, Mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of
probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events.

Two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of
different traits from different crosses. To find the probability of two or more
independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the
probabilities of the individual events. The use of the word “and” suggests the
appropriate application of the product rule. To find the probability of two or more
events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual
probabilities together. The use of the word “or” suggests the appropriate application of
the sum rule.

The seven characteristics that Mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each
expressed as one of two versions, or traits. The physical expression of
characteristics is accomplished through the expression of genes carried on
chromosomes. The genetic makeup of peas consists of two similar or
homologous copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Each pair
of homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes. In other
words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each
chromosome. The same is true for many other plants and for virtually all
animals. Diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes,
which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite at
fertilization to create a diploid zygote.

For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid
organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same
version of that characteristic. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist
at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called
alleles. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele
forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given
gene in a natural population.

Phenotypes and Genotypes
Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and
interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed
by an organism are referred to as its phenotype. An organism’s underlying
genetic makeup, consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed
alleles, is called its genotype. Mendel’s hybridization experiments
demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. When true-
breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had green
pods were cross-fertilized, all of the F1 hybrid offspring had yellow pods.
That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-
breeding parent with yellow pods. However, we know that the allele
donated by the parent with green pods was not simply lost because it
reappeared in some of the F2 offspring. Therefore, the F1 plants must have
been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods.

The P1 plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous
for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are homozygous at a
given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their
homologous chromosomes. Mendel’s parental pea plants always bred true
because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. When P1
plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were
heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that their genotype reflected
that they had different alleles for the gene being examined.



Dominant and Recessive Alleles

Our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to
why the F1 heterozygous offspring were identical to one of the parents,
rather than expressing both alleles. In all seven pea-plant characteristics,
one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was
recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the
recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that
these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosome
pairs. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern,
homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that
is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). The
recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals
([link]).

   Wooly hair                       Tay-Sachs disease

Several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles. For the
purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes using the first letter of the
gene’s corresponding dominant trait. For example, violet is the dominant
trait for a pea plant’s flower color, so the flower-color gene would be
abbreviated as V (note that it is customary to italicize gene designations).
Furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent
dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. Therefore, we would refer to
the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as
VV, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as vv, and a
heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as Vv.

The Punnett Square Approach for a Monohybrid Cross
When fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in
only one characteristic, the process is called a monohybrid cross, and the
resulting offspring are monohybrids. Mendel performed seven monohybrid
crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic. On the basis of
his results in F1 and F2 generations, Mendel postulated that each parent in
the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each
offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.

To demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea
plants with yellow versus green pea seeds. The dominant seed color is
yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were YY for the plants with yellow
seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds, respectively. A Punnett
square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, can be drawn
that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a
genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies. To prepare a Punnett
square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the
top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, representing
their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. Then the combinations of
egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are
combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or
fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. Because each possibility is
equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If
the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic
ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding
parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one
genotype is possible. All offspring are Yy and have yellow seeds ([link]).
  In the P generation, pea plants that
  are true-breeding for the dominant
  yellow phenotype are crossed with
    plants with the recessive green
  phenotype. This cross produces F1
      heterozygotes with a yellow
       phenotype. Punnett square
  analysis can be used to predict the
    genotypes of the F2 generation.



A self-cross of one of the Yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a
2 × 2 Punnett square because each parent can donate one of two different
alleles. Therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele
combinations: YY, Yy, yY, or yy ([link]). Notice that there are two ways to
obtain the Yy genotype: a Y from the egg and a y from the sperm, or a y
from the egg and a Y from the sperm. Both of these possibilities must be
counted. Recall that Mendel’s pea-plant characteristics behaved in the same
way in reciprocal crosses. Therefore, the two possible heterozygous
combinations produce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically
identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different
parents. They are grouped together. Because fertilization is a random event,
we expect each combination to be equally likely and for the offspring to
exhibit a ratio of YY:Yy:yy genotypes of 1:2:1 ([link]). Furthermore, because
the YY and Yy offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical,
applying the sum rule of probability, we expect the offspring to exhibit a
phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green. Indeed, working with large sample
sizes, Mendel observed approximately this ratio in every F2 generation
resulting from crosses for individual traits.

Mendel validated these results by performing an F3 cross in which he self-
crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing F2 plants. When he self-
crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green
seeds, confirming that all green seeds had homozygous genotypes of yy.
When he self-crossed the F2 plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that
one-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a
3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. In this case, the true-breeding plants had
homozygous (YY) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded
to the heterozygous (Yy) genotype. When these plants self-fertilized, the
outcome was just like the F1 self-fertilizing cross.



The Test Cross Distinguishes the Dominant Phenotype

Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or
heterozygous parents, Mendel also developed a way to determine whether
an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a
homozygote. Called the test cross, this technique is still used by plant and
animal breeders. In a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is
crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same
characteristic. If the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then
all F1 offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait ([link]).
Alternatively, if the dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote, the F1
offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive
homozygotes ([link]). The test cross further validates Mendel’s postulate
that pairs of unit factors segregate equally.

In pea plants, round peas (R) are dominant to wrinkled peas (r). You do a
test cross between a pea plant with wrinkled peas (genotype rr) and a plant
of unknown genotype that has round peas. You end up with three plants, all
which have round peas. From this data, can you tell if the round pea parent
plant is homozygous dominant or heterozygous? If the round pea parent
plant is heterozygous, what is the probability that a random sample of 3
progeny peas will all be round?



Many human diseases are genetically inherited. A healthy person in a
family in which some members suffer from a recessive genetic disorder
may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk
exists of passing the disorder on to his or her offspring. Of course, doing a
test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. Instead, geneticists use
pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic
diseases ([link]).

   Alkaptonuria is a recessive genetic
      disorder in which two amino
   acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine,
     are not properly metabolized.
    Affected individuals may have
     darkened skin and brown urine,
    and may suffer joint damage and
        other complications. In this
      pedigree, individuals with the
    disorder are indicated in blue and
    have the genotype aa. Unaffected
   individuals are indicated in yellow
    and have the genotype AA or Aa.
      Note that it is often possible to
      determine a person’s genotype
        from the genotype of their
    offspring. For example, if neither
     parent has the disorder but their
          child does, they must be
    heterozygous. Two individuals on
     the pedigree have an unaffected
   phenotype but unknown genotype.
       Because they do not have the
     disorder, they must have at least
         one normal allele, so their
           genotype gets the “A?”
                designation.


What are the genotypes of the individuals labeled 1, 2 and 3?



Alternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness
Mendel’s experiments with pea plants suggested that: (1) two “units” or
alleles exist for every gene; (2) alleles maintain their integrity in each
generation (no blending); and (3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the
recessive allele is hidden and makes no contribution to the phenotype.
Therefore, recessive alleles can be “carried” and not expressed by
individuals. Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as
“carriers.” Further genetic studies in other plants and animals have shown
that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of
Mendelian genetics still hold true. In the sections to follow, we consider
some of the extensions of Mendelism. If Mendel had chosen an
experimental system that exhibited these genetic complexities, it’s possible
that he would not have understood what his results meant.



Incomplete Dominance

Mendel’s results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs,
contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their
parents’ traits. However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does
appear to be intermediate between the two parents. For example, in the
snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus ([link]), a cross between a homozygous
parent with white flowers (CWCW) and a homozygous parent with red
flowers (CRCR) will produce offspring with pink flowers (CRCW). (Note that
different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to
distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness.) This
pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting the
expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an
intermediate phenotype. The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant
over the allele for white flowers. However, the results of a heterozygote
self-cross can still be predicted, just as with Mendelian dominant and
recessive crosses. In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 CRCR:2
CRCW:1 CWCW, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white.

Codominance

A variation on incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both
alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the
heterozygote. An example of codominance is the MN blood groups of
humans. The M and N alleles are expressed in the form of an M or N
antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (LMLM and
LNLN) express either the M or the N allele, and heterozygotes (LMLN)
express both alleles equally. In a self-cross between heterozygotes
expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are
phenotypically distinct. However, the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of
a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies.



Multiple Alleles

Mendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive,
could exist for a given gene. We now know that this is an
oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms)
can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple alleles may exist at the
population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed.
Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to
denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the
wild type (often abbreviated “+”); this is considered the standard or norm.
All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard,
meaning that they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive
or dominant to the wild-type allele.

An example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits ([link]). Here, four
alleles exist for the c gene. The wild-type version, C+C+, is expressed as
brown fur. The chinchilla phenotype, cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped
white fur. The Himalayan phenotype, chch, has black fur on the extremities
and white fur elsewhere. Finally, the albino, or “colorless” phenotype, cc, is
expressed as white fur. In cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies
can exist. In this case, the wild-type allele is dominant over all the others,
chinchilla is incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino, and
Himalayan is dominant over albino. This hierarchy, or allelic series, was
revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote
offspring.
  Four different alleles exist for the rabbit coat color
                        (C) gene.



The complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants
often occurs as an effect of “dosage” of a specific gene product, such that
the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the
mutant alleles cannot. For the allelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele
may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply a
lesser dosage or none at all. Interestingly, the Himalayan phenotype is the
result of an allele that produces a temperature-sensitive gene product that
only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbit’s body.

Alternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes,
including the wild type. This may occur when the mutant allele somehow
interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one
wild-type allele copy expresses the mutant phenotype. One way in which
the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wild-type
gene product or changing its distribution in the body. One example of this is
the Antennapedia mutation in Drosophila ([link]). In this case, the mutant
allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the
Antennapedia heterozygote develops legs on its head where its antennae
should be.




  As seen in comparing the
    wild-type Drosophila
         (left) and the
    Antennapedia mutant
  (right), the Antennapedia
    mutant has legs on its
  head in place of antennae.

Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite
Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected
female mosquitoes, including Anopheles gambiae ([link]a), and is
characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe
anemia. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are the most common
causative agents of malaria, and P. falciparum is the most deadly ([link]b).
When promptly and correctly treated, P. falciparum malaria has a mortality
rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world, the parasite has
evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most
effective malarial treatments can vary by geographic region.




  The (a) Anopheles gambiae, or African malaria
  mosquito, acts as a vector in the transmission to
     humans of the malaria-causing parasite (b)
   Plasmodium falciparum, here visualized using
   false-color transmission electron microscopy.
     (credit a: James D. Gathany; credit b: Ute
  Frevert; false color by Margaret Shear; scale-bar
               data from Matt Russell)


In Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, P. falciparum has developed
resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. P. falciparum, which is haploid during the life
stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug-
resistant mutant alleles of the dhps gene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine
resistance are associated with each of these alleles. Being haploid, P.
falciparum needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.
In Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the dhps gene
are localized to different geographic regions. This is a common
evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise
in a population and interbreed with other P. falciparum isolates in close
proximity. Sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human
hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an over-the-counter
malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large
numbers within an infection cycle, P. falciparum evolves relatively rapidly
(over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of commonly
used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to
develop new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria
burden.[footnote]

X-Linked Traits

In humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the
individual is determined by sex chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are
one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only
considered inheritance patterns among non-sex chromosomes, or
autosomes. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human
females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human males
have an XY chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains a
small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during
meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer
genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X chromosome, but
not on the Y chromosome, it is said to be X-linked.

Eye color in Drosophila was one of the first X-linked traits to be identified.
Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X chromosome in 1910. Like
humans, Drosophila males have an XY chromosome pair, and females are
XX. In flies, the wild-type eye color is red (XW) and it is dominant to white
eye color (Xw) ([link]). Because of the location of the eye-color gene,
reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said
to be hemizygous, because they have only one allele for any X-linked
characteristic. Hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and
recessiveness irrelevant for XY males. Drosophila males lack a second
allele copy on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be XWY
or XwY. In contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be
XWXW, XWXw, or XwXw.
  In Drosophila, several
   genes determine eye
   color. The genes for
   white and vermilion
  eye colors are located
          on the X
   chromosome. Others
     are located on the
  autosomes. Clockwise
      from top left are
     brown, cinnabar,
     sepia, vermilion,
    white, and red. Red
  eye color is wild-type
    and is dominant to
      white eye color.



In an X-linked cross, the genotypes of F1 and F2 offspring depend on
whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male or the female in the
P1 generation. With regard to Drosophila eye color, when the P1 male
expresses the white-eye phenotype and the female is homozygous red-eyed,
all members of the F1 generation exhibit red eyes ([link]). The F1 females
are heterozygous (XWXw), and the males are all XWY, having received their
X chromosome from the homozygous dominant P1 female and their Y
chromosome from the P1 male. A subsequent cross between the XWXw
female and the XWY male would produce only red-eyed females (with
XWXW or XWXw genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with XWY
or XwY genotypes). Now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-
eyed female and a male with red eyes. The F1 generation would exhibit only
heterozygous red-eyed females (XWXw) and only white-eyed males (XwY).
Half of the F2 females would be red-eyed (XWXw) and half would be white-
eyed (XwXw). Similarly, half of the F2 males would be red-eyed (XWY) and
half would be white-eyed (XwY).

   Punnett square analysis is used to determine
   the ratio of offspring from a cross between a
     red-eyed male fruit fly and a white-eyed
                female fruit fly.

What ratio of offspring would result from a cross between a white-eyed
male and a female that is heterozygous for red eye color?



Discoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics. When a
female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked trait, she will pass the
trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. Her male offspring are, therefore,
destined to express the trait, as they will inherit their father's Y
chromosome. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of
color blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked.
Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and
may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease
to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters;
therefore, recessive X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than
females.

In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-
homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather than the male. This is
the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to
appear in the female, in which they are hemizygous.



Human Sex-linked Disorders

Sex-linkage studies in Morgan’s laboratory provided the fundamentals for
understanding X-linked recessive disorders in humans, which include red-
green color blindness, and Types A and B hemophilia. Because human
males need to inherit only one recessive mutant X allele to be affected, X-
linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. Females must
inherit recessive X-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to
express the trait. When they inherit one recessive X-linked mutant allele
and one dominant X-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and
are typically unaffected. Carrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait
due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the X
chromosomes. However, female carriers can contribute the trait to their
sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute the
recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers
of the trait ([link]). Although some Y-linked recessive disorders exist,
typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not
transmitted to subsequent generations.




   The son of a woman who is a carrier
   of a recessive X-linked disorder will
    have a 50 percent chance of being
     affected. A daughter will not be
      affected, but she will have a 50
   percent chance of being a carrier like
                her mother.

Lethality

A large proportion of genes in an individual’s genome are essential for
survival. Occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an essential gene can arise
by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with
this allele also have a wild-type, functional copy. The wild-type allele
functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered
to be dominant over the nonfunctional allele. However, consider two
heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wild-type/nonfunctional
mutant for a hypothetical essential gene. In one quarter of their offspring,
we would expect to observe individuals that are homozygous recessive for
the nonfunctional allele. Because the gene is essential, these individuals
might fail to develop past fertilization, die in utero, or die later in life,
depending on what life stage requires this gene. An inheritance pattern in
which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the
heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non-lethal phenotype is
referred to as recessive lethal.

For crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele
that causes death before birth when homozygous, only wild-type
homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed. The genotypic ratio
would therefore be 2:1. In other instances, the recessive lethal allele might
also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote. For
instance, the recessive lethal Curly allele in Drosophila affects wing shape
in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote.

A single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal
functioning or even survival. The dominant lethal inheritance pattern is
one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the
heterozygote; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype
occurs after reproductive age. Individuals with mutations that result in
dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form.
Dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the
allele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted. However, just as the
recessive lethal allele might not immediately manifest the phenotype of
death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood.
Once the individual reaches reproductive age, the allele may be
unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations.
An example of this in humans is Huntington’s disease, in which the nervous
system gradually wastes away ([link]). People who are heterozygous for the
dominant Huntington allele (Hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease.
However, the onset of Huntington’s disease may not occur until age 40, at
which point the afflicted persons may have already passed the allele to 50
percent of their offspring.

Section Summary
When true-breeding or homozygous individuals that differ for a certain trait
are crossed, all of the offspring will be heterozygotes for that trait. If the
traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the F1 offspring will all
exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant
trait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting F2
offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or
recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are
homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are
homozygous recessive. Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous
individuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits in the F2
offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.

Alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns.
Incomplete dominance describes situations in which the heterozygote
exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous
phenotypes. Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of
the alleles in the heterozygote. Although diploid organisms can only have
two alleles for any given gene, it is common for more than two alleles of a
gene to exist in a population. In humans, as in many animals and some
plants, females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y
chromosome. Genes that are present on the X but not the Y chromosome
are said to be X-linked, such that males only inherit one allele for the gene,
and females inherit two. Finally, some alleles can be lethal. Recessive lethal
alleles are only lethal in homozygotes, but dominant lethal alleles are fatal
in heterozygotes as well.

Laws of Inheritance
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain Mendel’s law of segregation and independent assortment in
     terms of genetics and the events of meiosis
     Use the forked-line method and the probability rules to calculate the
     probability of genotypes and phenotypes from multiple gene crosses
     Explain the effect of linkage and recombination on gamete genotypes
     Explain the phenotypic outcomes of epistatic effects between genes

Mendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four
postulates, some of which are sometimes called “laws,” that describe the
basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms. As you
have learned, more complex extensions of Mendelism exist that do not
exhibit the same F2 phenotypic ratios (3:1). Nevertheless, these laws
summarize the basics of classical genetics.

Pairs of Unit Factors, or Genes
Mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted
faithfully from generation to generation by the dissociation and
reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization,
respectively. After he crossed peas with contrasting traits and found that the
recessive trait resurfaced in the F2 generation, Mendel deduced that
hereditary factors must be inherited as discrete units. This finding
contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended in the
offspring.

Alleles Can Be Dominant or Recessive
Mendel’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will
conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. Rather than
both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be
expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain “latent” but will be
transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is
transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that
have two copies of this allele ([link]), and these offspring will breed true
when self-crossed.

Since Mendel’s experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found
that the law of dominance does not always hold true. Instead, several
different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist.




    The child in the photo
    expresses albinism, a
       recessive trait.




Equal Segregation of Alleles
Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to
F1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F2 generations that
expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed
the law of segregation. This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must
segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood
of inheriting either factor. For the F2 generation of a monohybrid cross, the
following three possible combinations of genotypes could result:
homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because
heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one
dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because
heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically
identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The
equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to
accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The
physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of
meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different
versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. The role of the
meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not
understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime.

Independent Assortment
Mendel’s law of independent assortment states that genes do not
influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes, and
every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to
occur. The independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the
dihybrid cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express
different traits for two characteristics. Consider the characteristics of seed
color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that has green, wrinkled seeds
(yyrr) and another that has yellow, round seeds (YYRR). Because each
parent is homozygous, the law of segregation indicates that the gametes for
the green/wrinkled plant all are yr, and the gametes for the yellow/round
plant are all YR. Therefore, the F1 generation of offspring all are YyRr
([link]).



Note:
Art Connection
    This dihybrid cross of pea plants involves
      the genes for seed color and texture.


In pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p) and
yellow peas (Y) are dominant to green peas (y). What are the possible
genotypes and phenotypes for a cross between PpYY and ppYy pea plants?
How many squares do you need to do a Punnett square analysis of this
cross?



For the F2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete
receive either an R allele or an r allele along with either a Y allele or a y
allele. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an
r allele sorted would be equally likely to contain either a Y allele or a y
allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when
the YyRr heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: YR, Yr, yR, and yr.
Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square
([link]) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. From these
genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3
wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green ([link]). These are the offspring ratios we
would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough
sample size.

Because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid
phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios, characteristic of any
monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. Ignoring
seed color and considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we
would expect that three quarters of the F2 generation offspring would be
round, and one quarter would be wrinkled. Similarly, isolating only seed
color, we would assume that three quarters of the F2 offspring would be
yellow and one quarter would be green. The sorting of alleles for texture
and color are independent events, so we can apply the product rule.
Therefore, the proportion of round and yellow F2 offspring is expected to be
(3/4) × (3/4) = 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is
expected to be (1/4) × (1/4) = 1/16. These proportions are identical to those
obtained using a Punnett square. Round, green and wrinkled, yellow
offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of these
genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. Therefore,
the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4) × (1/4) = 3/16.

The law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between
yellow, wrinkled (YYrr) and green, round (yyRR) parents would yield the
same F1 and F2 offspring as in the YYRR x yyrr cross.

The physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in
meiosis I, in which the different homologous pairs line up in random
orientations. Each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and
maternal chromosomes (and therefore the genes on them) because the
orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random.



Forked-Line Method

When more than two genes are being considered, the Punnett-square
method becomes unwieldy. For instance, examining a cross involving four
genes would require a 16 × 16 grid containing 256 boxes. It would be
extremely cumbersome to manually enter each genotype. For more complex
crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred.

To prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between F1 heterozygotes
resulting from a cross between AABBCC and aabbcc parents, we first create
rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the
alleles in each row on forked lines according to the probabilities for
individual monohybrid crosses ([link]). We then multiply the values along
each forked path to obtain the F2 offspring probabilities. Note that this
process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule. The values along
each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts
independently. For a trihybrid cross, the F2 phenotypic ratio is
27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1.




    The forked-line method can be used to analyze a trihybrid
     cross. Here, the probability for color in the F2 generation
   occupies the top row (3 yellow:1 green). The probability for
   shape occupies the second row (3 round:1 wrinked), and the
   probability for height occupies the third row (3 tall:1 dwarf).
     The probability for each possible combination of traits is
   calculated by multiplying the probability for each individual
     trait. Thus, the probability of F2 offspring having yellow,
               round, and tall traits is 3 × 3 × 3, or 27.
Probability Method

While the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track
of probabilities in a cross, the probability method gives the proportions of
offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the
added visual assistance. Both methods make use of the product rule and
consider the alleles for each gene separately. Earlier, we examined the
phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method;
now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic
proportions for a cross with even more genes.

For a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit
not as tedious as using the Punnett-square method. To fully demonstrate the
power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic
calculations. For instance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that
are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes are sorting
independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of
the offspring will be expected to be homozygous recessive for all four
alleles? Rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the
probability method. We know that for each gene, the fraction of
homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. Therefore, multiplying this
fraction for each of the four genes, (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4) × (1/4), we
determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous
recessive.

For the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring
that have the dominant phenotype at all four loci? We can answer this
question using phenotypic proportions, but let’s do it the hard way—using
genotypic proportions. The question asks for the proportion of offspring
that are 1) homozygous dominant at A or heterozygous at A, and 2)
homozygous at B or heterozygous at B, and so on. Noting the “or” and
“and” in each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and
product rules. The probability of a homozygous dominant at A is 1/4 and
the probability of a heterozygote at A is 1/2. The probability of the
homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule. The
same probability can be obtained in the same way for each of the other
genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at A and B and C and
D is, using the product rule, equal to 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4, or 27/64. If you
are ever unsure about how to combine probabilities, returning to the forked-
line method should make it clear.



Rules for Multihybrid Fertilization

Predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is
the best way to test your knowledge of Mendelian genetics. Given a
multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a
dominant and recessive pattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use
these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations
([link]). To apply these rules, first you must determine n, the number of
heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two alleles each).
For example, a cross between AaBb and AaBb heterozygotes has an n of 2.
In contrast, a cross between AABb and AABb has an n of 1 because A is not
heterozygous.

Linked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment
Although all of Mendel’s pea characteristics behaved according to the law
of independent assortment, we now know that some allele combinations are
not inherited independently of each other. Genes that are located on
separate non-homologous chromosomes will always sort independently.
However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes,
organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation
of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage, in which genes that
are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are
more likely to be inherited as a pair. However, because of the process of
recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same
chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To
understand this, let’s consider the biological basis of gene linkage and
recombination.

Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order.
The alleles may differ on homologous chromosome pairs, but the genes to
which they correspond do not. In preparation for the first division of
meiosis, homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse. Like genes on
the homologs align with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous
chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material ([link]). This
process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic
process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene
order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and
paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given
chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive
shuffling of alleles.
  The process of crossover, or
  recombination, occurs when
        two homologous
   chromosomes align during
     meiosis and exchange a
  segment of genetic material.
   Here, the alleles for gene C
  were exchanged. The result is
    two recombinant and two
        non-recombinant
         chromosomes.



When two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome,
they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be transmitted through
meiosis together. To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving
flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on
the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants
and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and
yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles
will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into
other gametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have
been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes.
But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no
gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red
alleles. If you create the Punnett square with these gametes, you will see
that the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid
cross would not apply. As the distance between two genes increases, the
probability of one or more crossovers between them increases, and the
genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have
used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents)
as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this
information, they have constructed elaborate maps of genes on
chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.

Mendel’s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many
researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not
to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his
independent assortment postulate. The garden pea has seven chromosomes,
and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a
coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on
separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage
because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.



Note:
Scientific Method Connection
Testing the Hypothesis of Independent Assortment
To better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into
Mendel’s experiments, proceed through one of Mendel’s dihybrid crosses.
Question: What will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross?
Background: Consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and
you have access to a large garden in which you can cultivate thousands of
pea plants. There are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs
of traits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted
pods. Before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing
organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-
fertilization. Upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed by
transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the
tall/inflated plants.
Hypothesis: Both trait pairs will sort independently according to
Mendelian laws. When the true-breeding parents are crossed, all of the F1
offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and
inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits,
respectively. A self-cross of the F1 heterozygotes results in 2,000 F2
progeny.
Test the hypothesis: Because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios
of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each expected to be 3:1. The
tall/dwarf trait pair is called T/t, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is
designated I/i. Each member of the F1 generation therefore has a genotype
of TtIi. Construct a grid analogous to [link], in which you cross two TtIi
individuals. Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: TI,
Ti, tI, or ti, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes.
Because the T and I alleles are dominant, any individual having one or two
of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively,
regardless if they also have a t or i allele. Only individuals that are tt or ii
will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. As shown in
[link], you predict that you will observe the following offspring
proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/inflated:dwarf/constricted in
a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Notice from the grid that when considering the tall/dwarf
and inflated/constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in
3:1 ratios.
     This figure shows all possible
       combinations of offspring
   resulting from a dihybrid cross of
    pea plants that are heterozygous
          for the tall/dwarf and
      inflated/constricted alleles.


Test the hypothesis: You cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross
the offspring. For best results, this is repeated with hundreds or even
thousands of pea plants. What special precautions should be taken in the
crosses and in growing the plants?
Analyze your data: You observe the following plant phenotypes in the F2
generation: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/constricted, 888 dwarf/inflated, and
300 dwarf/constricted. Reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if
they are consistent with Mendelian laws.
Form a conclusion: Were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1
phenotypic ratio? Do the results support the prediction? What might be
observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate
randomly into gametes? Try to imagine growing that many pea plants, and
consider the potential for experimental error. For instance, what would
happen if it was extremely windy one day?
Epistasis
Mendel’s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual’s
phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them, unit factors), such
that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a
single gene. In fact, single observable characteristics are almost always
under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting
in unison. For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in
humans.



Note:
Link to Learning




Eye color in humans is determined by multiple genes. Use the Eye Color
Calculator to predict the eye color of children from parental eye color.



In some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common
phenotype without their gene products ever directly interacting. In the case
of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially,
with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes
may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or
more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype.
Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene modifying the expression
of another.

In epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one
gene masks or interferes with the expression of another. “Epistasis” is a
word composed of Greek roots that mean “standing upon.” The alleles that
are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles
that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a
gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the
function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.

An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color,
agouti (AA), is dominant to solid-colored fur (aa). However, a separate gene
(C) is necessary for pigment production. A mouse with a recessive c allele
at this locus is unable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the
allele present at locus A ([link]). Therefore, the genotypes AAcc, Aacc, and
aacc all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes
for both genes (AaCc x AaCc) would generate offspring with a phenotypic
ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino ([link]). In this case, the C gene is
epistatic to the A gene.
  In mice, the mottled agouti coat color
   (A) is dominant to a solid coloration,
     such as black or gray. A gene at a
    separate locus (C) is responsible for
   pigment production. The recessive c
  allele does not produce pigment, and a
  mouse with the homozygous recessive
  cc genotype is albino regardless of the
  allele present at the A locus. Thus, the
      C gene is epistatic to the A gene.



Epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a
separate gene. Fruit color in summer squash is expressed in this way.
Homozygous recessive expression of the W gene (ww) coupled with
homozygous dominant or heterozygous expression of the Y gene (YY or Yy)
generates yellow fruit, and the wwyy genotype produces green fruit.
However, if a dominant copy of the W gene is present in the homozygous or
heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless
of the Y alleles. A cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (WwYy
× WwYy) would produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12 white:3
yellow:1 green.

Finally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the
dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same phenotype. In the
shepherd’s purse plant (Capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed
shape is controlled by two genes in a dominant epistatic relationship. When
the genes A and B are both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are
ovoid. If the dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is
triangular seeds. That is, every possible genotype other than aabb results in
triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (AaBb x
AaBb) would yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1
ovoid.

As you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single
characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that totals 16 is typical of a
two-gene interaction. Recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for
Mendel’s dihybrid cross, which considered two non-interacting genes—
9:3:3:1. Similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit
ratios expressed as 16 parts. Note that we are assuming the interacting
genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently into gametes.

Section Summary
Mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of
alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. Alleles
segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive
either one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual. In addition,
genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. That is,
alleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a
particular allele of another gene. A dihybrid cross demonstrates
independent assortment when the genes in question are on different
chromosomes or distant from each other on the same chromosome. For
crosses involving more than two genes, use the forked line or probability
methods to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes rather than a
Punnett square.
Although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis,
Mendel’s law of independent assortment refers to genes, not chromosomes,
and a single chromosome may carry more than 1,000 genes. When genes
are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to
be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel's
law of independent assortment. However, recombination serves to exchange
genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and
paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is why
alleles on a given chromosome are not always inherited together.
Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome.
Therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to
still assort independently because of recombination events that occurred in
the intervening chromosomal space.

Whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the
level of gene products such that the expression of an allele for one gene
masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene. This is
called epistasis.

The ability to reproduce in kind is a basic characteristic of all living things.
In kind means that the offspring of any organism closely resemble their
parent or parents. Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves,
Joshua trees produce seeds from which Joshua tree seedlings emerge, and
adult flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. In kind does not
generally mean exactly the same. Whereas many unicellular organisms and
a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically identical clones of
themselves through cell division, many single-celled organisms and most
multicellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method. Sexual
reproduction is the production by parents of two haploid cells and the
fusion of two haploid cells to form a single, unique diploid cell. In most
plants and animals, through tens of rounds of mitotic cell division, this
diploid cell will develop into an adult organism. Haploid cells that are part
of the sexual reproductive cycle are produced by a type of cell division
called meiosis. Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization,
introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary
success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms,
both multicellular and unicellular, can or must employ some form of
meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.
The Process of Meiosis
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis
     Describe cellular events during meiosis
     Explain the differences between meiosis and mitosis
     Explain the mechanisms within meiosis that generate genetic variation
     among the products of meiosis

Sexual reproduction requires fertilization, the union of two cells from two
individual organisms. If those two cells each contain one set of
chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes.
Haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes. Cells containing two sets of
chromosomes are called diploid. The number of sets of chromosomes in a
cell is called its ploidy level. If the reproductive cycle is to continue, then
the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets
before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in
the number of chromosome sets in every generation. So, in addition to
fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division that reduces
the number of chromosome sets.

Most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes.
In each somatic cell of the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism
except the gametes or reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies
of each chromosome, called homologous chromosomes. Somatic cells are
sometimes referred to as “body” cells. Homologous chromosomes are
matched pairs containing the same genes in identical locations along their
length. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous
chromosome from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of
chromosomes. Haploid cells, containing a single copy of each homologous
chromosome, are found only within structures that give rise to either
gametes or spores. Spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid
organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell. All animals
and most plants produce eggs and sperm, or gametes. Some plants and all
fungi produce spores.

The nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is
related to mitosis. As you have learned, mitosis is the part of a cell
reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also
genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. In mitosis, both the
parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy level—diploid for
most plants and animals. Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms
as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei
that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. To achieve this
reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of
chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division. Because the
events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the
events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. However, because
there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are
designated with a “I” or a “II.” Thus, meiosis I is the first round of meiotic
division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Meiosis II,
in which the second round of meiotic division takes place, includes
prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.

Meiosis I
Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G1, S, and G2 phases,
which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. The G1 phase,
which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase
and is focused on cell growth. The S phase is the second phase of
interphase, during which the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated.
Finally, the G2 phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final
phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations
for meiosis.

During DNA duplication in the S phase, each chromosome is replicated to
produce two identical copies, called sister chromatids, that are held together
at the centromere by cohesin proteins. Cohesin holds the chromatids
together until anaphase II. The centrosomes, which are the structures that
organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate. This
prepares the cell to enter prophase I, the first meiotic phase.



Prophase I
Early in prophase I, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly
microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are attached at their tips to
the nuclear envelope by proteins. As the nuclear envelope begins to break
down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair
close to each other. Recall that, in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do
not pair together. In mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end
so that when they divide, each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid
from both members of the homologous pair. The synaptonemal complex, a
lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at
specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the
chromosomes. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called
synapsis. In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous
chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. The synaptonemal
complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-
sister homologous chromatids, a process called crossing over. Crossing over
can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular =
chiasma) ([link]).

In species such as humans, even though the X and Y sex chromosomes are
not homologous (most of their genes differ), they have a small region of
homology that allows the X and Y chromosomes to pair up during prophase
I. A partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of
homology.
   Early in prophase I, homologous
    chromosomes come together to
  form a synapse. The chromosomes
   are bound tightly together and in
     perfect alignment by a protein
     lattice called a synaptonemal
   complex and by cohesin proteins
           at the centromere.



Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein
assemblies called recombination nodules. These assemblies mark the
points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover—
or genetic recombination—between the non-sister chromatids. Near the
recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded DNA is
cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between
the non-sister chromatids. As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal
complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense.
When the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes
remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. The
chiasmata remain until anaphase I. The number of chiasmata varies
according to the species and the length of the chromosome. There must be
at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous
chromosomes during meiosis I, but there may be as many as 25. Following
crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin
connection between homologous pairs is also removed. At the end of
prophase I, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ([link]) and are
called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of
homologous chromosomes are now visible.

The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei
produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between homologous non-
sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA
between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when
that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some DNA
from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The
sister recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal
genes that did not exist before the crossover. Multiple crossovers in an arm
of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of DNA to
create recombinant chromosomes.




   Crossover occurs between non-sister
        chromatids of homologous
      chromosomes. The result is an
   exchange of genetic material between
       homologous chromosomes.
Prometaphase I

The key event in prometaphase I is the attachment of the spindle fiber
microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres. Kinetochore
proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a
chromosome to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Microtubules grow
from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules
move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused
homologous chromosomes. The microtubules attach at each chromosomes'
kinetochores. With each member of the homologous pair attached to
opposite poles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the
homologous pair apart. A spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is
called a kinetochore microtubule. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad
is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous
chromosome facing each pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held
together at chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down
entirely.



Metaphase I

During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the
center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles. The
homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. For example,
if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then
the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a. This is important in determining
the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two
homologous chromosomes. Recall that homologous chromosomes are not
identical. They contain slight differences in their genetic information,
causing each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup.

This randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of
genetic variation in offspring. Consider that the homologous chromosomes
of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate
sets, one from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23
chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. The father
provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the
egg. Every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the original two
sets of homologous chromosomes. In prophase I of meiosis, the
homologous chromosomes form the tetrads. In metaphase I, these pairs line
up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the
metaphase plate. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber
will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the
arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Any
maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. Any paternally
inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each
tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.

This event—the random (or independent) assortment of homologous
chromosomes at the metaphase plate—is the second mechanism that
introduces variation into the gametes or spores. In each cell that undergoes
meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. The number of
variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set.
There are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the
possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n, where n is the number
of chromosomes per set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results
in over eight million (223) possible genetically-distinct gametes. This
number does not include the variability that was previously created in the
sister chromatids by crossover. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly
unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the
same genetic composition ([link]).

To summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I, the maternal and
paternal genes are recombined by crossover events that occur between each
homologous pair during prophase I. In addition, the random assortment of
tetrads on the metaphase plate produces a unique combination of maternal
and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.
   Random, independent assortment during metaphase I can be
       demonstrated by considering a cell with a set of two
     chromosomes (n = 2). In this case, there are two possible
  arrangements at the equatorial plane in metaphase I. The total
  possible number of different gametes is 2n, where n equals the
    number of chromosomes in a set. In this example, there are
   four possible genetic combinations for the gametes. With n =
        23 in human cells, there are over 8 million possible
      combinations of paternal and maternal chromosomes.




Anaphase I
In anaphase I, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart. The
sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the centromere. The
chiasmata are broken in anaphase I as the microtubules attached to the
fused kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart ([link]).



Telophase I and Cytokinesis

In telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. The
remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur, depending
on the species. In some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and
nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase I. In other
organisms, cytokinesis—the physical separation of the cytoplasmic
components into two daughter cells—occurs without reformation of the
nuclei. In nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis
separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin
ring that leads to cytoplasmic division). In plants, a cell plate is formed
during cell cytokinesis by Golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. This
cell plate will ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the
two daughter cells.

Two haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division. The cells
are haploid because at each pole, there is just one of each pair of the
homologous chromosomes. Therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes
is present. This is why the cells are considered haploid—there is only one
chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister
chromatids. Recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the
two homologous chromosomes (except for changes that occurred during
crossing over). In meiosis II, these two sister chromatids will separate,
creating four haploid daughter cells.

migrate, at Meiosis: An Interactive Animation.



Meiosis II
In some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before
entering meiosis II. Interkinesis lacks an S phase, so chromosomes are not
duplicated. The two cells produced in meiosis I go through the events of
meiosis II in synchrony. During meiosis II, the sister chromatids within the
two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. The
mechanics of meiosis II is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell
has only one set of homologous chromosomes. Therefore, each cell has half
the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing
mitosis.



Prophase II

If the chromosomes decondensed in telophase I, they condense again. If
nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into vesicles. The
centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each
other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed.



Prometaphase II

The nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully
formed. Each sister chromatid forms an individual kinetochore that attaches
to microtubules from opposite poles.



Metaphase II

The sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator
of the cell.



Anaphase II

The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and
move toward opposite poles. Non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the
cell.
  The process of chromosome alignment differs between meiosis
  I and meiosis II. In prometaphase I, microtubules attach to the
     fused kinetochores of homologous chromosomes, and the
  homologous chromosomes are arranged at the midpoint of the
        cell in metaphase I. In anaphase I, the homologous
  chromosomes are separated. In prometaphase II, microtubules
   attach to the kinetochores of sister chromatids, and the sister
       chromatids are arranged at the midpoint of the cells in
       metaphase II. In anaphase II, the sister chromatids are
                             separated.




Telophase II and Cytokinesis

The chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense.
Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes. Cytokinesis separates the
two cells into four unique haploid cells. At this point, the newly formed
nuclei are both haploid. The cells produced are genetically unique because
of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because
of the recombining of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes
(with their sets of genes) that occurs during crossover. The entire process of
meiosis is outlined in [link].
An animal cell with a diploid number of four (2n = 4)
 proceeds through the stages of meiosis to form four
               haploid daughter cells.
Comparing Meiosis and Mitosis
Mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic
cells. They share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that
lead to very different outcomes ([link]). Mitosis is a single nuclear division
that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. The
nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the
original nucleus. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one
set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. In
most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo
mitosis to form new diploid cells. In contrast, meiosis consists of two
nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into
four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically
identical and they contain one chromosome set only. This is half the number
of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid.

The main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis I, which
is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In meiosis I, the
homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are
bound together with the synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and
undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the
metaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle
poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. All of these
events occur only in meiosis I.

When the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs
moving to one pole or another, the ploidy level—the number of sets of
chromosomes in each future nucleus—has been reduced from two to one.
For this reason, meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division. There is no
such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis.

Meiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, the
duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the metaphase
plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite
poles. During anaphase II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide
and one sister chromatid—now referred to as a chromosome—is pulled to
one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it
were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two products of each
individual meiosis II division would be identical (like in mitosis). Instead,
they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per
chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division because although there
are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of
chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.




    Meiosis and mitosis are both preceded by one round of
   DNA replication; however, meiosis includes two nuclear
   divisions. The four daughter cells resulting from meiosis
    are haploid and genetically distinct. The daughter cells
     resulting from mitosis are diploid and identical to the
                          parent cell.
Note:
Evolution Connection
The Mystery of the Evolution of Meiosis
Some characteristics of organisms are so widespread and fundamental that
it is sometimes difficult to remember that they evolved like other simpler
traits. Meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series of cellular events
that biologists have had trouble hypothesizing and testing how it may have
evolved. Although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual
reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages, it is important to
separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex,
because early meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons
than it is now. Thinking outside the box and imagining what the early
benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how
it may have evolved.
Meiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense
that meiosis evolved from mitosis. The difficulty lies in the clear
differences between meiosis I and mitosis. Adam Wilkins and Robin
Holliday[footnote] summarized the unique events that needed to occur for the
evolution of meiosis from mitosis. These steps are homologous
chromosome pairing, crossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining
attached during anaphase, and suppression of DNA replication in
interphase. They argue that the first step is the hardest and most important,
and that understanding how it evolved would make the evolutionary
process clearer. They suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on
the evolution of synapsis.
Adam S. Wilkins and Robin Holliday, “The Evolution of Meiosis from
Mitosis,” Genetics 181 (2009): 3–12.
There are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in
progress. Different forms of meiosis exist in single-celled protists. Some
appear to be simpler or more “primitive” forms of meiosis. Comparing the
meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of
meiosis. Marilee Ramesh and colleagues[footnote] compared the genes
involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis
might have evolved. Although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship
into meiosis in protists suggests that some aspects of meiosis may have
evolved later than others. This kind of genetic comparison can tell us what
aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have
borrowed from in earlier cells.

Section Summary
Sexual reproduction requires that diploid organisms produce haploid cells
that can fuse during fertilization to form diploid offspring. As with mitosis,
DNA replication occurs prior to meiosis during the S-phase of the cell
cycle. Meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes
and chromatids into daughter cells. During the interphases of meiosis, each
chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear
division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells, each with
half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The first separates
homologs, and the second—like mitosis—separates chromatids into
individual chromosomes. During meiosis, variation in the daughter nuclei is
introduced because of crossover in prophase I and random alignment of
tetrads at metaphase I. The cells that are produced by meiosis are
genetically unique.

Meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but have distinct outcomes. Mitotic
divisions are single nuclear divisions that produce daughter nuclei that are
genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome sets as the
original cell. Meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that produce
four daughter nuclei that are genetically different and have one
chromosome set instead of the two sets of chromosomes in the parent cell.
The main differences between the processes occur in the first division of
meiosis, in which homologous chromosomes are paired and exchange non-
sister chromatid segments. The homologous chromosomes separate into
different nuclei during meiosis I, causing a reduction of ploidy level in the
first division. The second division of meiosis is more similar to a mitotic
division, except that the daughter cells do not contain identical genomes
because of crossover.

Free Response
Exercise:

  Problem:Describe the process that results in the formation of a tetrad.

  Solution:

  During the meiotic interphase, each chromosome is duplicated. The
  sister chromatids that are formed during synthesis are held together at
  the centromere region by cohesin proteins. All chromosomes are
  attached to the nuclear envelope by their tips. As the cell enters
  prophase I, the nuclear envelope begins to fragment, and the proteins
  holding homologous chromosomes locate each other. The four sister
  chromatids align lengthwise, and a protein lattice called the
  synaptonemal complex is formed between them to bind them together.
  The synaptonemal complex facilitates crossover between non-sister
  chromatids, which is observed as chiasmata along the length of the
  chromosome. As prophase I progresses, the synaptonemal complex
  breaks down and the sister chromatids become free, except where they
  are attached by chiasmata. At this stage, the four chromatids are visible
  in each homologous pairing and are called a tetrad.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  Explain how the random alignment of homologous chromosomes
  during metaphase I contributes to the variation in gametes produced by
  meiosis.

  Solution:

  Random alignment leads to new combinations of traits. The
  chromosomes that were originally inherited by the gamete-producing
  individual came equally from the egg and the sperm. In metaphase I,
  the duplicated copies of these maternal and paternal homologous
  chromosomes line up across the center of the cell. The orientation of
  each tetrad is random. There is an equal chance that the maternally
  derived chromosomes will be facing either pole. The same is true of
  the paternally derived chromosomes. The alignment should occur
  differently in almost every meiosis. As the homologous chromosomes
  are pulled apart in anaphase I, any combination of maternal and
  paternal chromosomes will move toward each pole. The gametes
  formed from these two groups of chromosomes will have a mixture of
  traits from the individual’s parents. Each gamete is unique.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  What is the function of the fused kinetochore found on sister
  chromatids in prometaphase I?
  Solution:

  In metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes line up at the metaphase
  plate. In anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart
  and move to opposite poles. Sister chromatids are not separated until
  meiosis II. The fused kinetochore formed during meiosis I ensures that
  each spindle microtubule that binds to the tetrad will attach to both
  sister chromatids.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  In a comparison of the stages of meiosis to the stages of mitosis, which
  stages are unique to meiosis and which stages have the same events in
  both meiosis and mitosis?

  Solution:

  All of the stages of meiosis I, except possibly telophase I, are unique
  because homologous chromosomes are separated, not sister
  chromatids. In some species, the chromosomes do not decondense and
  the nuclear envelopes do not form in telophase I. All of the stages of
  meiosis II have the same events as the stages of mitosis, with the
  possible exception of prophase II. In some species, the chromosomes
  are still condensed and there is no nuclear envelope. Other than this,
  all processes are the same.

Sexual Reproduction
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain that meiosis and sexual reproduction are evolved traits
     Identify variation among offspring as a potential evolutionary
     advantage to sexual reproduction
     Describe the three different life-cycle types among sexual multicellular
     organisms and their commonalities

Sexual reproduction was an early evolutionary innovation after the
appearance of eukaryotic cells. It appears to have been very successful
because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many
animals, it is the only mode of reproduction. And yet, scientists recognize
some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, creating
offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system.
If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with
the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious
benefit to an organism that can produce offspring whenever circumstances
are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. These
methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite
sex. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the
ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, in asexual populations, every
individual is capable of reproduction. In sexual populations, the males are
not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual population
could grow twice as fast.

However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual
reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexuality (and meiosis) so
common? This is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and
has been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the
twentieth century. There are several possible explanations, one of which is
that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very
important to the survival and reproduction of the population. Thus, on
average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants
than an otherwise similar asexually reproducing population. The only
source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate
source of variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different
mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when
different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed
into different combinations by crossovers during prophase I and random
assortment at metaphase I.



Note:
Evolution Connection
The Red Queen Hypothesis
It is not in dispute that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary
advantages to organisms that employ this mechanism to produce offspring.
But why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, does sexual
reproduction persist when it is more difficult and costly for individual
organisms? Variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are
ongoing variations necessary? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first
proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.[footnote] The concept was named in
reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's book, Through the
Looking-Glass.
Leigh Van Valen, “A New Evolutionary Law,” Evolutionary Theory 1
(1973): 1–30
All species co-evolve with other organisms; for example predators evolve
with their prey, and parasites evolve with their hosts. Each tiny advantage
gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over close
competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. The only method that will
allow a co-evolving species to maintain its own share of the resources is to
also continually improve its fitness. As one species gains an advantage,
this increases selection on the other species; they must also develop an
advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species progresses too
far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual
reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly.
Species that cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen’s catchphrase
was, “It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place.” This is
an apt description of co-evolution between competing species.
Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms
Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles. What happens
between these two events depends on the organism. The process of meiosis
reduces the chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two
haploid gametes, restores the diploid condition. There are three main
categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant, in
which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as
with most animals including humans; haploid-dominant, in which the
multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with all
fungi and some algae; and alternation of generations, in which the two
stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group, as with
plants and some algae.



Diploid-Dominant Life Cycle

Nearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which
the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes. Early in
the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called germ cells,
are produced within the gonads, such as the testes and ovaries. Germ cells
are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce
gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to
divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life stage. Fertilization
occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals,
restoring the diploid state ([link]).
  In animals, sexually reproducing adults form haploid
     gametes from diploid germ cells. Fusion of the
   gametes gives rise to a fertilized egg cell, or zygote.
  The zygote will undergo multiple rounds of mitosis to
  produce a multicellular offspring. The germ cells are
    generated early in the development of the zygote.




Haploid-Dominant Life Cycle

Most fungi and algae employ a life-cycle type in which the “body” of the
organism—the ecologically important part of the life cycle—is haploid. The
haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage
are formed by mitosis. During sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells
from two individuals, designated the (+) and (−) mating types, join to form
a diploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four
haploid cells called spores. Although haploid like the “parents,” these
spores contain a new genetic combination from two parents. The spores can
remain dormant for various time periods. Eventually, when conditions are
conducive, the spores form multicellular haploid structures by many rounds
of mitosis ([link]).

       Fungi, such as black bread mold (Rhizopus
   nigricans), have haploid-dominant life cycles. The
     haploid multicellular stage produces specialized
   haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid
   zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis to produce
        haploid spores. Each spore gives rise to a
   multicellular haploid organism by mitosis. (credit

If a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus
mating type, will it still be able to reproduce?
Alternation of Generations

The third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is a blend
of the haploid-dominant and diploid-dominant extremes. Species with
alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular
organisms as part of their life cycle. The haploid multicellular plants are
called gametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells.
Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case,
because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid.
Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will
undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular
plant called a sporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo
meiosis and produce haploid spores. The spores will subsequently develop
into the gametophytes ([link]).




      Plants have a life cycle that alternates between a
     multicellular haploid organism and a multicellular
   diploid organism. In some plants, such as ferns, both
    the haploid and diploid plant stages are free-living.
     The diploid plant is called a sporophyte because it
      produces haploid spores by meiosis. The spores
      develop into multicellular, haploid plants called
     gametophytes because they produce gametes. The
  gametes of two individuals will fuse to form a diploid
   zygote that becomes the sporophyte. (credit “fern”:

  Soul"/Wikimedia Commons; credit “gametophyte and
         sporophyte”: modification of work by
           “Vlmastra”/Wikimedia Commons)



Although all plants utilize some version of the alternation of generations,
the relative size of the sporophyte and the gametophyte and the relationship
between them vary greatly. In plants such as moss, the gametophyte
organism is the free-living plant, and the sporophyte is physically
dependent on the gametophyte. In other plants, such as ferns, both the
gametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte
is much larger. In seed plants, such as magnolia trees and daisies, the
gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female
gametophyte, is completely retained within the sporophyte.

Sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms.
However, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis produces haploid
cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism. The
mechanisms of variation—crossover, random assortment of homologous
chromosomes, and random fertilization—are present in all versions of
sexual reproduction. The fact that nearly every multicellular organism on
Earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of
producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other
possible benefits as well.

Section Summary
Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. The variation
introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis appears to be one of the
advantages of sexual reproduction that has made it so successful. Meiosis
and fertilization alternate in sexual life cycles. The process of meiosis
produces unique reproductive cells called gametes, which have half the
number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Fertilization, the fusion of
haploid gametes from two individuals, restores the diploid condition. Thus,
sexually reproducing organisms alternate between haploid and diploid
stages. However, the ways in which reproductive cells are produced and the
timing between meiosis and fertilization vary greatly. There are three main
categories of life cycles: diploid-dominant, demonstrated by most animals;
haploid-dominant, demonstrated by all fungi and some algae; and the
alternation of generations, demonstrated by plants and some algae.

The gene is the physical unit of inheritance, and genes are arranged in a
linear order on chromosomes. The behaviors and interactions of
chromosomes during meiosis explain, at a cellular level, the patterns of
inheritance that we observe in populations. Genetic disorders involving
alterations in chromosome number or structure may have dramatic effects
and can prevent a fertilized egg from developing altogether.
Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Discuss Sutton’s Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
     Describe genetic linkage
     Explain the process of homologous recombination, or crossing over
     Describe how chromosome maps are created
     Calculate the distances between three genes on a chromosome using a
     three-point test cross

Long before chromosomes were visualized under a microscope, the father
of modern genetics, Gregor Mendel, began studying heredity in 1843. With
the improvement of microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell
biologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and
observe their actions during cell division and meiosis. With each mitotic
division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous (no
constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies (pairs of
identical sister chromatids), and migrated to separate cellular poles.

Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
The speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding
heredity led several scientists to examine Mendel’s publications and re-
evaluate his model in terms of the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis
and meiosis. In 1902, Theodor Boveri observed that proper embryonic
development of sea urchins does not occur unless chromosomes are present.
That same year, Walter Sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into
daughter cells during meiosis ([link]). Together, these observations led to
the development of the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, which
identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for Mendelian
inheritance.
    (a) Walter Sutton and (b)
   Theodor Boveri are credited
       with developing the
    Chromosomal Theory of
  Inheritance, which states that
   chromosomes carry the unit
       of heredity (genes).



The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance was consistent with Mendel’s
laws and was supported by the following observations:

    During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairs migrate as discrete
    structures that are independent of other chromosome pairs.
    The sorting of chromosomes from each homologous pair into pre-
    gametes appears to be random.
    Each parent synthesizes gametes that contain only half of their
    chromosomal complement.
    Even though male and female gametes (sperm and egg) differ in size
    and morphology, they have the same number of chromosomes,
    suggesting equal genetic contributions from each parent.
    The gametic chromosomes combine during fertilization to produce
    offspring with the same chromosome number as their parents.

Despite compelling correlations between the behavior of chromosomes
during meiosis and Mendel’s abstract laws, the Chromosomal Theory of
Inheritance was proposed long before there was any direct evidence that
traits were carried on chromosomes. Critics pointed out that individuals had
far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes. It
was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster, that Thomas Hunt Morgan provided
experimental evidence to support the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance.

Genetic Linkage and Distances
Mendel’s work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each
other. Morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence between a segregating trait
and the X chromosome, suggesting that the random segregation of
chromosomes was the physical basis of Mendel’s model. This also
demonstrated that linked genes disrupt Mendel’s predicted outcomes. The
fact that each chromosome can carry many linked genes explains how
individuals can have many more traits than they have chromosomes.
However, observations by researchers in Morgan’s laboratory suggested
that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited
together. During meiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked.



Homologous Recombination

In 1909, Frans Janssen observed chiasmata—the point at which chromatids
are in contact with each other and may exchange segments—prior to the
first division of meiosis. He suggested that alleles become unlinked and
chromosomes physically exchange segments. As chromosomes condensed
and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct points.
Janssen suggested that these points corresponded to regions in which
chromosome segments were exchanged. It is now known that the pairing
and interaction between homologous chromosomes, known as synapsis,
does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate
daughter cells. When synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo
reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous
recombination, or more simply, “crossing over.”
To better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were
obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous individual that inherited
dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such as
AB) and two recessive paternal alleles for those same genes (such as ab). If
the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes
that are either AB or ab with a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the
individual should produce AB, Ab, aB, and ab gametes with equal
frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment.
Because they correspond to new allele combinations, the genotypes Ab and
aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination
during meiosis. Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic
combination as their parents. Morgan and his colleagues, however, found
that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous
recessive parent (AaBb × aabb), both parental and nonparental cases
occurred. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were either
AaBb or aabb, but 50 offspring would also be obtained that were either
Aabb or aaBb. These results suggested that linkage occurred most often, but
a significant minority of offspring were the products of recombination.



Note:
Art Connection
   Inheritance patterns of unlinked and
    linked genes are shown. In (a), two
       genes are located on different
chromosomes so independent assortment
  occurs during meiosis. The offspring
     have an equal chance of being the
     parental type (inheriting the same
combination of traits as the parents) or a
 nonparental type (inheriting a different
 combination of traits than the parents).
In (b), two genes are very close together
   on the same chromosome so that no
crossing over occurs between them. The
   genes are therefore always inherited
 together and all of the offspring are the
    parental type. In (c), two genes are far
      apart on the chromosome such that
       crossing over occurs during every
       meiotic event. The recombination
      frequency will be the same as if the
    genes were on separate chromosomes.
   (d) The actual recombination frequency
    of fruit fly wing length and body color
    that Thomas Morgan observed in 1912
    was 17 percent. A crossover frequency
       between 0 percent and 50 percent
   indicates that the genes are on the same
   chromosome and crossover occurs some
                   of the time.


In a test cross for two characteristics such as the one shown here, can the
predicted frequency of recombinant offspring be 60 percent? Why or why
not?



Genetic Maps

Janssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it
remained an abstract idea that was not widely accepted. Scientists thought
chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how
chromosomes could break and rejoin. Yet, the data were clear that linkage
did not always occur. Ultimately, it took a young undergraduate student and
an “all-nighter” to mathematically elucidate the problem of linkage and
recombination.

In 1913, Alfred Sturtevant, a student in Morgan’s laboratory, gathered
results from researchers in the laboratory, and took them home one night to
mull them over. By the next morning, he had created the first “chromosome
map,” a linear representation of gene order and relative distance on a
chromosome ([link]).

Which of the following statements is true?

  a. Recombination of the body color and red/cinnabar eye alleles will
     occur more frequently than recombination of the alleles for wing
     length and aristae length.
  b. Recombination of the body color and aristae length alleles will occur
     more frequently than recombination of red/brown eye alleles and the
     aristae length alleles.
  c. Recombination of the gray/black body color and long/short aristae
     alleles will not occur.
  d. Recombination of the red/brown eye and long/short aristae alleles will
     occur more frequently than recombination of the alleles for wing
     length and body color.
As shown in [link], by using recombination frequency to predict genetic
distance, the relative order of genes on chromosome 2 could be inferred.
The values shown represent map distances in centimorgans (cM), which
correspond to recombination frequencies (in percent). Therefore, the genes
for body color and wing size were 65.5 − 48.5 = 17 cM apart, indicating
that the maternal and paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17
percent of offspring, on average.

To construct a chromosome map, Sturtevant assumed that genes were
ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. He also assumed that the
incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could
occur with equal likelihood anywhere along the length of the chromosome.
Operating under these assumptions, Sturtevant postulated that alleles that
were far apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during
meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which recombination
could occur. Conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the
chromosome were likely to be inherited together. The average number of
crossovers between two alleles—that is, their recombination frequency—
correlated with their genetic distance from each other, relative to the
locations of other genes on that chromosome. Considering the example
cross between AaBb and aabb above, the frequency of recombination could
be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05. That is, the likelihood of a crossover
between genes A/a and B/b was 0.05, or 5 percent. Such a result would
indicate that the genes were definitively linked, but that they were far
enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur. Sturtevant divided his
genetic map into map units, or centimorgans (cM), in which a
recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cM.

By representing alleles in a linear map, Sturtevant suggested that genes can
range from being perfectly linked (recombination frequency = 0) to being
perfectly unlinked (recombination frequency = 0.5) when genes are on
different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same
chromosome. Perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies
predicted by Mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross. A
recombination frequency of 0.5 indicates that 50 percent of offspring are
recombinants and the other 50 percent are parental types. That is, every
type of allele combination is represented with equal frequency. This
representation allowed Sturtevant to additively calculate distances between
several genes on the same chromosome. However, as the genetic distances
approached 0.50, his predictions became less accurate because it was not
clear whether the genes were very far apart on the same chromosome or on
different chromosomes.

In 1931, Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton demonstrated the
crossover of homologous chromosomes in corn plants. Weeks later,
homologous recombination in Drosophila was demonstrated
microscopically by Curt Stern. Stern observed several X-linked phenotypes
that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar X
chromosome pair in which one X was missing a small terminal segment,
and the other X was fused to a piece of the Y chromosome. By crossing
flies, observing their offspring, and then visualizing the offspring’s
chromosomes, Stern demonstrated that every time the offspring allele
combination deviated from either of the parental combinations, there was a
corresponding exchange of an X chromosome segment. Using mutant flies
with structurally distinct X chromosomes was the key to observing the
products of recombination because DNA sequencing and other molecular
tools were not yet available. It is now known that homologous
chromosomes regularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally
breaking and rejoining their DNA at precise locations.

recombination frequencies here.
Mendel’s Mapped Traits

Homologous recombination is a common genetic process, yet Mendel never
observed it. Had he investigated both linked and unlinked genes, it would
have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data
on the basis of probabilistic calculations. Researchers who have since
mapped the seven traits investigated by Mendel onto the seven
chromosomes of the pea plant genome have confirmed that all of the genes
he examined are either on separate chromosomes or are sufficiently far
apart as to be statistically unlinked. Some have suggested that Mendel was
enormously lucky to select only unlinked genes, whereas others question
whether Mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage. In any case, Mendel
consistently observed independent assortment because he examined genes
that were effectively unlinked.

Section Summary
The Chromosomal Theory of inheritance, proposed by Sutton and Boveri,
states that chromosomes are the vehicles of genetic heredity. Neither
Mendelian genetics nor gene linkage is perfectly accurate; instead,
chromosome behavior involves segregation, independent assortment, and
occasionally, linkage. Sturtevant devised a method to assess recombination
frequency and infer the relative positions and distances of linked genes on a
chromosome on the basis of the average number of crossovers in the
intervening region between the genes. Sturtevant correctly presumed that
genes are arranged in serial order on chromosomes and that recombination
between homologs can occur anywhere on a chromosome with equal
likelihood. Whereas linkage causes alleles on the same chromosome to be
inherited together, homologous recombination biases alleles toward an
inheritance pattern of independent assortment.

Forming and Testing a Hypothesis

This needs to The first thing any scientist does before performing an
experiment is to form a hypothesis about the experiment's outcome. This
often takes the form of a null hypothesis, which is a statistical hypothesis
that provides the expected values for an experiment. The null hypothesis is
proposed by a scientist before completing an experiment, and it can be
supported by data or disproved in favor of an alternate hypothesis.

Let's consider some examples of the use of the null hypothesis in a genetics
experiment. Remember that Mendelian inheritance deals with traits that
show discontinuous variation, which means that the phenotypes fall into
distinct categories. As a consequence, in a Mendelian genetic cross, the null
hypothesis is usually an extrinsic hypothesis; in other words, the expected
proportions can be predicted and calculated before the experiment starts.
Then an experiment can be designed to determine whether the data confirm
or reject the hypothesis. On the other hand, in another experiment, you
might hypothesize that two genes are linked. This is called an intrinsic
hypothesis, which is a hypothesis in which the expected proportions are
calculated after the experiment is done using some information from the
experimental data (McDonald, 2008).
How Math Merged with Biology

But how did mathematics and genetics come to be linked through the use of
hypotheses and statistical analysis? The key figure in this process was Karl
Pearson, a turn-of-the-century mathematician who was fascinated with
biology. When asked what his first memory was, Pearson responded by
saying, "Well, I do not know how old I was, but I was sitting in a high chair
and I was sucking my thumb. Someone told me to stop sucking it and said
that if I did so, the thumb would wither away. I put my two thumbs together
and looked at them a long time. ‘They look alike to me,' I said to myself, ‘I
can't see that the thumb I suck is any smaller than the other. I wonder if she
could be lying to me'" (Walker, 1958). As this anecdote illustrates, Pearson
was perhaps born to be a scientist. He was a sharp observer and intent on
interpreting his own data. During his career, Pearson developed statistical
theories and applied them to the exploration of biological data. His
innovations were not well received, however, and he faced an arduous
struggle in convincing other scientists to accept the idea that mathematics
should be applied to biology. For instance, during Pearson's time, the Royal
Society, which is the United Kingdom's academy of science, would accept
papers that concerned either mathematics or biology, but it refused to
accept papers than concerned both subjects (Walker, 1958). In response,
Pearson, along with Francis Galton and W. F. R. Weldon, founded a new
journal called Biometrika in 1901 to promote the statistical analysis of data
on heredity. Pearson's persistence paid off. Today, statistical tests are
essential for examining biological data.



Pearson's Chi-Square Test for Goodness-of-Fit

One of Pearson's most significant achievements occurred in 1900, when he
developed a statistical test called Pearson's chi-square (Χ2) test, also known
as the chi-square test for goodness-of-fit (Pearson, 1900). Pearson's chi-
square test is used to examine the role of chance in producing deviations
between observed and expected values. The test depends on an extrinsic
hypothesis, because it requires theoretical expected values to be calculated.
The test indicates the probability that chance alone produced the deviation
between the expected and the observed values (Pierce, 2005). When the
probability calculated from Pearson's chi-square test is high, it is assumed
that chance alone produced the difference. Conversely, when the probability
is low, it is assumed that a significant factor other than chance produced the
deviation.

In 1912, J. Arthur Harris applied Pearson's chi-square test to examine
Mendelian ratios (Harris, 1912). It is important to note that when Gregor
Mendel studied inheritance, he did not use statistics, and neither did
Bateson, Saunders, Punnett, and Morgan during their experiments that
discovered genetic linkage. Thus, until Pearson's statistical tests were
applied to biological data, scientists judged thegoodness of fit between
theoretical and observed experimental results simply by inspecting the data
and drawing conclusions (Harris, 1912). Although this method can work
perfectly if one's data exactly matches one's predictions, scientific
experiments often have variability associated with them, and this makes
statistical tests very useful.

The chi-square value is calculated using the following formula:

Using this formula, the difference between the observed and expected
frequencies is calculated for each experimental outcome category. The
difference is then squared and divided by the expectedfrequency. Finally,
the chi-square values for each outcome are summed together, as represented
by the summation sign (Σ).

Pearson's chi-square test works well with genetic data as long as there are
enough expected values in each group. In the case of small samples (less
than 10 in any category) that have 1 degree of freedom, the test is not
reliable. (Degrees of freedom, or df, will be explained in full later in this
article.) However, in such cases, the test can be corrected by using the Yates
correction for continuity, which reduces the absolute value of each
difference between observed and expected frequencies by 0.5 before
squaring. Additionally, it is important to remember that the chi-square test
can only be applied to numbers ofprogeny, not to proportions or
percentages.

Now that you know the rules for using the test, it's time to consider an
example of how to calculate Pearson's chi-square. Recall that when Mendel
crossed his pea plants, he learned that tall (T) wasdominant to short (t). You
want to confirm that this is correct, so you start by formulating the
following null hypothesis: In a cross between two heterozygote (Tt) plants,
the offspring should occur in a 3:1 ratio of tall plants to short plants. Next,
you cross the plants, and after the cross, you measure the

characteristics of 400 offspring. You note that there are 305 tall pea plants
and 95 short pea plants; these are your observed values. Meanwhile,
you expect that there will be 300 tall plants and 100 short plants from the
Mendelian ratio.

You are now ready to perform statistical analysis of your results, but first,
you have to choose a critical value at which to reject your null hypothesis.
You opt for a critical value probability of 0.01 (1%) that the deviation
between the observed and expected values is due to chance. This means that
if the probability is less than 0.01, then the deviation is significant and not
due to chance, and you will reject your null hypothesis. However, if the
deviation is greater than 0.01, then the deviation is not significant and you
will not reject the null hypothesis.

So, should you reject your null hypothesis or not? Here's a summary of your
observed and expected data:




                                     Tall                Short

  Expected                           300                 100

  Observed                           305                 95

Now, let's calculate Pearson's chi-square:

For tall plants: Χ2 = (305 - 300)2 / 300 = 0.08
For short plants: Χ2 = (95 - 100)2 / 100 = 0.25

The sum of the two categories is 0.08 + 0.25 = 0.33

Therefore, the overall Pearson's chi-square for the experiment is Χ2 = 0.33

Next, you determine the probability that is associated with your calculated
chi-square value. To do this, you compare your calculated chi-square value
with theoretical values in a chi-square table that has the same number of
degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom represent the number of ways in
which the observed outcome categories are free to vary. For Pearson's chi-
square test, the degrees of freedom are equal to n - 1, where n represents the
number of different expected phenotypes (Pierce, 2005). In your
experiment, there are two expected outcome phenotypes (tall and short),
so n = 2 categories, and the degrees of freedom equal 2 - 1 = 1. Thus, with
your calculated chi-square value (0.33) and the associated degrees of
freedom (1), you can determine the probability by using a chi-square table
(Table 1).

(Table adapted from Jones, 2008)

Note that the chi-square table is organized with degrees of freedom (df) in
the left column and probabilities (P) at the top. The chi-square values
associated with the probabilities are in the center of the table. To determine
the probability, first locate the row for the degrees of freedom for your
experiment, then determine where the calculated chi-square value would be
placed among the theoretical values in the corresponding row.

At the beginning of your experiment, you decided that if the probability was
less than 0.01, you would reject your null hypothesis because the deviation
would be significant

and not due to chance. Now, looking at the row that corresponds to 1 degree
of freedom, you see that your calculated chi-square value of 0.33 falls
between 0.016, which is associated with a probability of 0.9, and 2.706,
which is associated with a probability of 0.10. Therefore, there is between a
10% and 90% probability that the deviation you observed between your
expected and the observed numbers of tall and short plants is due to chance.
In other words, the probability associated with your chi-square value is
much greater than the critical value of 0.01. This means that we will reject
our null hypothesis, and the deviation between the observed and expected
results is not significant.



Level of Significance

Determining whether to accept or reject a hypothesis is decided by the
experimenter, who is the person who chooses the "level of significance" or
confidence. Scientists commonly use the 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001 probability
levels as cut-off values. For instance, in the example experiment, you used
the 0.01 probability. Thus, P ≥ 0.01, which can be interpreted to mean that
chance likely caused the deviation between the observed and the expected
values (i.e. there is a greater than 1% probability that chance explains the
data). If instead we had observed that P ≤ 0.01, this would mean that there
is less than a 1% probability that our data can be explained by chance.
There is a significant difference between our expected and observed results,
so the deviation must be caused by something other than chance.

Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe how a karyogram is created
     Explain how nondisjunction leads to disorders in chromosome number
     Compare disorders caused by aneuploidy
     Describe how errors in chromosome structure occur through inversions
     and translocations

Inherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during
meiosis. Chromosome disorders can be divided into two categories:
abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural
rearrangements. Because even small segments of chromosomes can span
many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and
often fatal.

Identification of Chromosomes
The isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis
of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect
chromosomal abnormalities in humans. A karyotype is the number and
appearance of chromosomes, and includes their length, banding pattern, and
centromere position. To obtain a view of an individual’s karyotype,
cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each
chromosome into a chart, or karyogram, also known as an ideogram
([link]).
       This karyotype is of a female human. Notice that homologous
      chromosomes are the same size, and have the same centromere
     positions and banding patterns. A human male would have an XY
     chromosome pair instead of the XX pair shown. (credit: Andreas
                                Blozer et al)



In a given species, chromosomes can be identified by their number, size,
centromere position, and banding pattern. In a human karyotype,
autosomes or “body chromosomes” (all of the non–sex chromosomes) are
generally organized in approximate order of size from largest (chromosome
1) to smallest (chromosome 22). The X and Y chromosomes are not
autosomes. However, chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome
22. This was discovered after the naming of Down syndrome as trisomy 21,
reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome
21 (three total). Not wanting to change the name of this important disease,
chromosome 21 retained its numbering, despite describing the shortest set
of chromosomes. The chromosome “arms” projecting from either end of the
centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative
lengths. The short arm is abbreviated p (for “petite”), whereas the long arm
is abbreviated q (because it follows “p” alphabetically). Each arm is further
subdivided and denoted by a number. Using this naming system, locations
on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature.



Note:
Career Connection
Geneticists Use Karyograms to Identify Chromosomal Aberrations
Although Mendel is referred to as the “father of modern genetics,” he
performed his experiments with none of the tools that the geneticists of
today routinely employ. One such powerful cytological technique is
karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal
abnormalities can be identified from a single cell. To observe an
individual’s karyotype, a person’s cells (like white blood cells) are first
collected from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, the isolated
cells are stimulated to begin actively dividing. A chemical called
colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes in
metaphase. Cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the
chromosomes spread apart. Finally, the sample is preserved in a fixative
and applied to a slide.
The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better
visualize the distinct and reproducible banding patterns of each
chromosome pair. Following staining, the chromosomes are viewed using
bright-field microscopy. A common stain choice is the Giemsa stain.
Giemsa staining results in approximately 400–800 bands (of tightly coiled
DNA and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23 chromosome
pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band. In addition to the
banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size
and centromere location. To obtain the classic depiction of the karyotype in
which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order
from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies
each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this
pattern ([link]).
At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which
an individual has too many or too few chromosomes per cell. Examples of
this are Down Syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of
chromosome 21, and Turner Syndrome, which is characterized by the
presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of the normal two.
Geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of DNA. For
instance, Jacobsen Syndrome—which involves distinctive facial features as
well as heart and bleeding defects—is identified by a deletion on
chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations, which
occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome
and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same
chromosome. Translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including
chronic myelogenous leukemia.
During Mendel’s lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could
only be inferred by performing crosses and observing the traits expressed
by offspring. By observing a karyogram, today’s geneticists can actually
visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or
predict genetic abnormalities in offspring, even before birth.
Disorders in Chromosome Number
Of all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number
are the most obviously identifiable from a karyogram. Disorders of
chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes,
as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes. They
are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when pairs of homologous
chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis.
Misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a dysfunction of the spindle
apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration, can cause nondisjunction.
The risk of nondisjunction occurring increases with the age of the parents.

Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with differing results
([link]). If homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis I, the
result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome and two gametes
with two copies of the chromosome. If sister chromatids fail to separate
during meiosis II, the result is one gamete that lacks that chromosome, two
normal gametes with one copy of the chromosome, and one gamete with
two copies of the chromosome.

     normal gametes.
  c. Nondisjunction during meiosis I results in 50 percent normal gametes.
  d. Nondisjunction always results in four different kinds of gametes.
Aneuploidy
An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their
species is called euploid; in humans, euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of
autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. An individual with an error in
chromosome number is described as aneuploid, a term that includes
monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous
chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an
autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential
genes. This underscores the importance of “gene dosage” in humans. Most
autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of
some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in
offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals
suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose.
Individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the
gene products encoded by that chromosome. This extra dose (150 percent)
of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often
precludes development. The most common trisomy among viable births is
that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to Down Syndrome. Individuals
with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted
digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and
significant developmental delays. The incidence of Down syndrome is
correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become
pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype ([link]).
    The incidence of having a fetus with
  trisomy 21 increases dramatically with
               maternal age.

Polyploidy
An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two
for diploid species) is called polyploid. For instance, fertilization of an
abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid
zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples
among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Polyploid
animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead
produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable zygotes.
Rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in
which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring. In
contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid
plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species
([link]).




    As with many polyploid plants,
      this triploid orange daylily
        (Hemerocallis fulva) is
   particularly large and robust, and
     grows flowers with triple the
    number of petals of its diploid
   counterparts. (credit: Steve Karg)
Sex Chromosome Nondisjunction in Humans
Humans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and
monosomies. Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that human females
and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the
X chromosome. Rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the
number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects. In
part, this occurs because of a molecular process called X inactivation.
Early in development, when female mammalian embryos consist of just a
few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one X chromosome
in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant)
structure called a Barr body. The chance that an X chromosome (maternally
or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the
inactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same
inactive X chromosome or Barr body. By this process, females compensate
for their double genetic dose of X chromosome. In so-called “tortoiseshell”
cats, embryonic X inactivation is observed as color variegation ([link]).
Females that are heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express
one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body,
corresponding to whichever X chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic
cell progenitor of that region.




    In cats, the gene for
    coat color is located
  on the X chromosome.
      In the embryonic
  development of female
  cats, one of the two X
       chromosomes is
   randomly inactivated
   in each cell, resulting
      in a tortoiseshell
    pattern if the cat has
    two different alleles
    for coat color. Male
   cats, having only one
  X chromosome, never
   exhibit a tortoiseshell
     coat color. (credit:
     Michael Bodega)



An individual carrying an abnormal number of X chromosomes will
inactivate all but one X chromosome in each of her cells. However, even
inactivated X chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and X
chromosomes must reactivate for the proper maturation of female ovaries.
As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with
mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome
is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in utero.

Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized.
Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, are phenotypically
female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY
genotype, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds
to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and
reduced body hair. More complex types of Klinefelter syndrome exist in
which the individual has as many as five X chromosomes. In all types,
every X chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for
the excess genetic dosage. This can be seen as several Barr bodies in each
cell nucleus. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 genotype (i.e., only a
single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual
with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac
impairments, and sterility.

Duplications and Deletions
In addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal
segment may be duplicated or lost. Duplications and deletions often
produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental
abnormalities. Duplicated chromosomal segments may fuse to existing
chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. Cri-du-chat (from the French
for “cry of the cat”) is a syndrome associated with nervous system
abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion
of most of 5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) ([link]). Infants with this
genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched cry on which the disorder’s
name is based.
    This individual with cri-du-chat
    syndrome is shown at two, four,
   nine, and 12 years of age. (credit:
        Paola Cerruti Mainardi)




Chromosomal Structural Rearrangements
Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in
chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and translocations are the most
common. Both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of
rearranged chromosomes with their former homologs to maintain
appropriate gene alignment. If the genes carried on two homologs are not
oriented correctly, a recombination event could result in the loss of genes
from one chromosome and the gain of genes on the other. This would
produce aneuploid gametes.
Chromosome Inversions

A chromosome inversion is the detachment, 180° rotation, and reinsertion
of part of a chromosome. Inversions may occur in nature as a result of
mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special DNA
sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome
segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste DNA sequences).
Unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation
of genes and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors.
However, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because
regulators of gene expression could be moved out of position with respect
to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products.

An inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere, or
paracentric and occur outside of the centromere ([link]). A pericentric
inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative
lengths of the chromosome arms, making these inversions easily
identifiable.




   Pericentric inversions include the
      centromere, and paracentric
    inversions do not. A pericentric
   inversion can change the relative
   lengths of the chromosome arms;
     a paracentric inversion cannot.


When one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other
does not, the individual is described as an inversion heterozygote. To
maintain point-for-point synapsis during meiosis, one homolog must form a
loop, and the other homolog must mold around it. Although this topology
can ensure that the genes are correctly aligned, it also forces the homologs
to stretch and can be associated with regions of imprecise synapsis ([link]).




  When one chromosome undergoes
    an inversion but the other does
   not, one chromosome must form
   an inverted loop to retain point-
      for-point interaction during
  synapsis. This inversion pairing is
     essential to maintaining gene
   alignment during meiosis and to
       allow for recombination.




Note:
Evolution Connection
The Chromosome 18 Inversion
Not all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable,
impaired, or infertile individuals. In rare instances, such a change can
result in the evolution of a new species. In fact, a pericentric inversion in
chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans.
This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the
chimpanzees. Humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by
pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two
separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two
in humans.
The pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in
early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with
chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers
characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000
nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region
inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human.
A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this
inversion indicates that two genes—ROCK1 and USP14—that are adjacent
on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome
18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18. This suggests
that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes.
Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees express USP14 at distinct levels in
specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. Perhaps the
chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific
genes and reset their expression levels in a useful way. Because both
ROCK1 and USP14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression
could alter cellular function. It is not known how this inversion contributed
to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the
divergence of humans from other primates.[footnote]

specific inversion of chromosome 18: a further example of the impact of
segmental duplications on karyotype and genome evolution in primates,”

Translocations

A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and
reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome. Translocations can
be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of
genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences. Notably, specific
translocations have been associated with several cancers and with
schizophrenia. Reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of
chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such
that there is no gain or loss of genetic information ([link]).

      when a segment of DNA is
  transferred from one chromosome
      to another, nonhomologous
  chromosome. (credit: modification

Section Summary
The number, size, shape, and banding pattern of chromosomes make them
easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows for the assessment of many
chromosomal abnormalities. Disorders in chromosome number, or
aneuploidies, are typically lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic
genotypes are viable. Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex
chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects. Aneuploidies also
include instances in which segments of a chromosome are duplicated or
deleted. Chromosome structures may also be rearranged, for example by
inversion or translocation. Both of these aberrations can result in
problematic phenotypic effects. Because they force chromosomes to assume
unnatural topologies during meiosis, inversions and translocations are often
associated with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of
nondisjunction.

of genomics. Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the
complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their
interactions within a species and with other species. The advances in
genomics have been made possible by DNA sequencing technology. Just as
information technology has led to Google maps that enable people to get
detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information
is used to create similar maps of the DNA of different organisms. These
findings have helped anthropologists to better understand human migration
and have aided the field of medicine through the mapping of human genetic
diseases. The ways in which genomic information can contribute to
scientific understanding are varied and quickly growing.
Mapping Genomes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Define genomics
     Describe genetic and physical maps
     Describe genomic mapping methods

Genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of
genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions
within a species and with other species. Genome mapping is the process of
finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. The maps created by
genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate
streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on
a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of
interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A
genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates
(shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. Early geneticists called this
linkage analysis. Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller
regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map). A physical
map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between
genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are
required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map
of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes.
Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human
disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and
cystic fibrosis. Genome mapping can be used in a variety of other
applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even
prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to
producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to
climate change.

Genetic Maps
The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that
analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they
are linked or show independent assortment. The term linkage was used
before the discovery of DNA. Early geneticists relied on the observation of
phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism. Shortly
after Gregor Mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits
were determined by what are now known as genes, other researchers
observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby
deduced that the genes were physically linked by being located on the same
chromosome. The mapping of genes relative to each other based on linkage
analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps.

Observations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were
not linked came from studying the offspring of crosses between parents
with different traits. For example, in experiments performed on the garden
pea, it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plant’s
pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were
in close proximity on the same chromosome. The exchange of DNA
between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic
recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of DNA between
homologous strands of DNA, such as nonsister chromatids. Linkage
analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two
genes. The greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance
that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher the
recombination frequency between them. Two possibilities for
recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis are shown
in [link]. If the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50
percent, they are said to be linked.
   Crossover may occur at different locations on the
  chromosome. Recombination between genes A and
    B is more frequent than recombination between
   genes B and C because genes A and B are farther
  apart; a crossover is therefore more likely to occur
                    between them.



The generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map
requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains). Early genetic maps were
based on the use of known genes as markers. More sophisticated markers,
including those based on non-coding DNA, are now used to compare the
genomes of individuals in a population. Although individuals of a given
species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a
unique set of traits. These minor differences in the genome between
individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping.
In general, a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows
variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population.

Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), variable number of tandem
repeats (VNTRs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RFLPs (sometimes pronounced “rif-
lips”) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction
endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a
series of DNA fragments, which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
The DNA of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands
when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases; this is
sometimes referred to as an individual’s DNA “fingerprint.” Certain regions
of the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the
generation of the unique banding pattern. VNTRs are repeated sets of
nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of DNA. Non-coding, or
“junk,” DNA has no known biological function; however, research shows
that much of this DNA is actually transcribed. While its function is
uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of
coding genes. The number of repeats may vary in individual organisms of a
population. Microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to VNTRs, but the
repeat unit is very small. SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide.

Because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of
recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases or decreases in the
level of recombination in any given area of the genome. Some parts of the
genome are recombination hotspots, whereas others do not show a
propensity for recombination. For this reason, it is important to look at
mapping information developed by multiple methods.

Physical Maps
A physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between
genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides. There are three
methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation
hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping. Cytogenetic mapping uses
information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the
chromosome ([link]). It is possible to determine the approximate distance
between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping, but not the exact
distance (number of base pairs). Radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation,
such as x-rays, to break the DNA into fragments. The amount of radiation
can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments. This technique
overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by
increased or decreased recombination frequency. Sequence mapping
resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of
detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of
base pairs. The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA
(cDNA) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a
genome) has sped up the process of physical mapping. A genetic site used
to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged
site, or STS) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact
chromosomal location. An expressed sequence tag (EST) and a single
sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) are common STSs. An EST is a
short STS that is identified with cDNA libraries, while SSLPs are obtained
from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and
physical maps.

Integration of Genetic and Physical Maps
Genetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details. It
is easy to understand why both types of genome mapping techniques are
important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each
technique is used in combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is
being used with different model organisms that are used for research.
Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced
techniques are developed, more advances are expected. Genome mapping is
similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available
data. Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is
entered into central databases, such as GenBank at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Efforts are being made to make the
information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public.
Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate
through roadways, NCBI has created a genome viewer tool to simplify the
data-mining process.

Section Summary
Genome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with
pieces of information coming from laboratories all over the world. Genetic
maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they
estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of
recombination frequencies during meiosis. Physical maps provide detailed
information about the physical distance between the genes. The most
detailed information is available through sequence mapping. Information
from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire
genome.

Whole-Genome Sequencing
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe three types of sequencing
     Define whole-genome sequencing

Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in
recent years, doctors are still confounded by some diseases, and they are
using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem.
Whole-genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence
of an entire genome. Whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach
to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease.
Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and
interpret entire genomes.

For example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole
genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing
regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was
used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious
abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally,
whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a
pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-marrow
transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for
the boy. He was the first person to be successfully treated based on a
diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing. Today, human genome
sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two
for about $1000.

Strategies Used in Sequencing Projects
The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects
is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which
was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method
involves DNA replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a
primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a
single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small
proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The
ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (–OH) at the site
at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain ([link]). Each
ddNTP is labeled with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP
is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the
process of DNA replication, which results in multiple short strands of
replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during
replication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis
after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA
strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs
are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA
strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different colors of
the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at
that position. Reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the
ladder produces the sequence of the template strand ([link]).




     A dideoxynucleotide is similar in
   structure to a deoxynucleotide, but is
       missing the 3' hydroxyl group
      (indicated by the box). When a
  dideoxynucleotide is incorporated into
   a DNA strand, DNA synthesis stops.
     Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain termination
    method is illustrated. Using dideoxynucleotides,
   the DNA fragment can be terminated at different
   points. The DNA is separated on the basis of size,
       and these bands, based on the size of the
                 fragments, can be read.




Early Strategies: Shotgun Sequencing and Pair-Wise End Sequencing

In shotgun sequencing method, several copies of a DNA fragment are cut
randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what happens to a round
shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). All of the segments are then
sequenced using the chain-sequencing method. Then, with the help of a
computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences overlap.
By matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the
entire DNA sequence can be reformed. A larger sequence that is assembled
from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. As an analogy,
consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you
have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear. The
person then rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size
pieces are present from each copy. The person then mixes all of the pieces
together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. In one of the smaller
pieces you see a mountain. In a larger piece, you see that the same mountain
is behind a lake. A third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that
there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. Therefore, from looking at the
overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture
contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. This is the
principle behind reconstructing entire DNA sequences using shotgun
sequencing.

Originally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for
overlaps. This was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. However, the
desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the
development of double-barrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as
pairwise-end sequencing. In pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of each
fragment are analyzed for overlap. Pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore,
more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct
the sequence because there is more available information.



Next-generation Sequencing

Since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are
under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of
automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing. These automated
low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or
millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day.
These sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome
process of putting all the fragments in order.



Note:
Evolution Connection
Comparing Sequences
A sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, DNA, or RNA; it is
used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which
may indicate conservation of function or structures. Sequence alignments
may be used to construct phylogenetic trees. The following website uses a
software program called BLAST (basic local alignment search tool).
Under “Basic Blast,” click “Nucleotide Blast.” Input the following
sequence into the large "query sequence" box: ATTGCTTCGATTGCA.
Below the box, locate the "Species" field and type "human" or "Homo
sapiens". Then click “BLAST” to compare the inputted sequence against
known sequences of the human genome. The result is that this sequence
occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome. Scroll down below
the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of
each of the matching hits. Pick one of the hits near the top of the list and
click on "Graphics". This will bring you to a page that shows where the
sequence is found within the entire human genome. You can move the
slider that looks like a green flag back and forth to view the sequences
immediately around the selected gene. You can then return to your selected
sequence by clicking the "ATG" button.



Use of Whole-Genome Sequences of Model Organisms
The first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the
bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was accomplished by Fred
Sanger using shotgun sequencing. Several other organelle and viral
genomes were later sequenced. The first organism whose genome was
sequenced was the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae; this was
accomplished by Craig Venter in the 1980s. Approximately 74 different
laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in
1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been
sequenced. By 1997, the genome sequences of two important model
organisms were available: the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomes of other model organisms, such as the
mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode
Caenorhabditis. elegans, and humans Homo sapiens are now known. A lot
of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information
can be applied to genetically similar organisms. A model organism is a
species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in
other species represented by the model organism. Having entire genomes
sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. The
process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called
genome annotation. Annotation of gene sequences helps with basic
experiments in molecular biology, such as designing PCR primers and RNA
targets.

Uses of Genome Sequences
DNA microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by
analyzing an array of DNA fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a
silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences. Almost one
million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays,
whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six
billion base pairs in the human genome. Although the study of medical
applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to
dwell on abnormal gene function. Knowledge of the entire genome will
allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered
early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about
lifestyle, medication, and having children. Genomics is still in its infancy,
although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing
to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities.

In addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the
development of novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel, which
results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer.
This knowledge should allow better methods of control over the microbes
that are used in the production of biofuels. Genomics could also improve
the methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and
help clean up environmental contaminants. Genomics has allowed for the
development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit
medical science and agriculture.

It sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome
sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to use this knowledge
wisely. Otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge,
leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic
engineering, and other ethical concerns. This information could also lead to
legal issues regarding health and privacy.

Section Summary
Whole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic
diseases. Some doctors are using whole-genome sequencing to save lives.
Genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel development,
agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. The basic principle of
all modern-day sequencing strategies involves the chain termination method
of sequencing.

Although the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical
professionals, researchers use whole-genome sequences of model organisms
to better understand the genome of the species. Automation and the
decreased cost of whole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized
medicine in the future.

The three letters “DNA” have now become synonymous with crime
solving, paternity testing, human identification, and genetic testing. DNA
can be retrieved from hair, blood, or saliva. Each person’s DNA is unique,
and it is possible to detect differences between individuals within a species
on the basis of these unique features.

DNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics. In humans,
DNA testing is applied to numerous uses: determining paternity, tracing
genealogy, identifying pathogens, archeological research, tracing disease
outbreaks, and studying human migration patterns. In the medical field,
DNA is used in diagnostics, new vaccine development, and cancer therapy.
It is now possible to determine predisposition to diseases by looking at
genes.

Each human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes: one set of chromosomes is
inherited from the mother and the other set is inherited from the father.
There is also a mitochondrial genome, inherited exclusively from the
mother, which can be involved in inherited genetic disorders. On each
chromosome, there are thousands of genes that are responsible for
determining the genotype and phenotype of the individual. A gene is
defined as a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional product. The
human haploid genome contains 3 billion base pairs and has between
20,000 and 25,000 functional genes.

     State and explain Chargaff’s rules

Modern understandings of DNA have evolved from the discovery of
nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. In the 1860s,
Friedrich Miescher ([link]), a physician by profession, was the first person
to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes.
He named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as RNA and
DNA) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells.




    Friedrich
    Miescher
  (1844–1895)
   discovered
  nucleic acids.

To see Miescher conduct an experiment step-by-step, click through this
review of how he discovered the key role of DNA and proteins in the
nucleus.



A half century later, British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps
the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred
from one cell to another “horizontally,” rather than by descent. In 1928, he
reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in
which external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology
and physiology. He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the
bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains, rough
(R) and smooth (S). The R strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease)
and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a
capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope.
The S strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its
cell wall. As a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope.
Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived. In another
experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain, they also
survived. In a third set of experiments, a mixture of live R strain and heat-
killed S strain were injected into mice, and—to his surprise—the mice died.
Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the S strain of
bacteria was recovered. When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh
mice, the mice died. Griffith concluded that something had passed from the
heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the
pathogenic S strain, and he called this the transforming principle ([link]).
These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation
experiments.
       Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used in Griffith’s
  transformation experiments. The R strain is non-pathogenic.
   The S strain is pathogenic and causes death. When Griffith
    injected a mouse with the heat-killed S strain and a live R
   strain, the mouse died. The S strain was recovered from the
    dead mouse. Thus, Griffith concluded that something had
        passed from the heat-killed S strain to the R strain,
  transforming the R strain into S strain in the process. (credit
   "living mouse": modification of work by NIH; credit "dead
        mouse": modification of work by Sarah Marriage)



Scientists Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty (1944)
were interested in exploring this transforming principle further. They
isolated the S strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and
nucleic acids, namely RNA and DNA, as these were possible candidates for
the molecule of heredity. They conducted a systematic elimination study.
They used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then
used each mixture separately to transform the R strain. They found that
when DNA was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to
transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to
transform the bacteria. This led them to conclude that DNA was the
transforming principle.

Forensic Scientists and DNA Analysis
DNA evidence was used for the first time to solve an immigration case.
The story started with a teenage boy returning to London from Ghana to be
with his mother. Immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of
him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. After much
persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the immigration
authorities did not drop the case against him. All types of evidence,
including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation
proceedings were started nevertheless. Around the same time, Dr. Alec
Jeffreys of Leicester University in the United Kingdom had invented a
technique known as DNA fingerprinting. The immigration authorities
approached Dr. Jeffreys for help. He took DNA samples from the mother
and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and compared the
samples with the boy’s DNA. Because the biological father was not in the
picture, DNA from the three children was compared with the boy’s DNA.
He found a match in the boy’s DNA for both the mother and his three
siblings. He concluded that the boy was indeed the mother’s son.
Forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting,
firearms, and biological samples. They analyze the DNA content of hair,
semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of DNA profiles
of known criminals. Analysis includes DNA isolation, sequencing, and
sequence analysis; most forensic DNA analysis involves polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification of short tandem repeat (STR) loci and
electrophoresis to determine the length of the PCR-amplified fragment.
Only mitochondrial DNA is sequenced for forensics. Forensic scientists are
expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings. They are
usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies.
Geneticists experimenting with DNA techniques also work for scientific
and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and
university labs. Students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist
should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics,
and preferably some experience working in a laboratory.
Experiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952
provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not
proteins. Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a
virus that infects bacteria. Viruses typically have a simple structure: a
protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the
genetic material, either DNA or RNA. The bacteriophage infects the host
bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids
inside the cell. The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the
host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number
of bacteriophages. Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with
radioactive sulfur, 35S, to label the protein coat. Another batch of phage
were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, 32P. Because phosphorous is
found in DNA, but not protein, the DNA and not the protein would be
tagged with radioactive phosphorus.

Each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. After
infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused
the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. The phage and bacterial
suspension was spun down in a centrifuge. The heavier bacterial cells
settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed
in the supernatant. In the tube that contained phage labeled with 35S, the
supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no
radioactivity was detected in the pellet. In the tube that contained the phage
labeled with 32P, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained
the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the
supernatant. Hershey and Chase concluded that it was the phage DNA that
was injected into the cell and carried information to produce more phage
particles, thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and
not proteins ([link]).
     In Hershey and Chase's experiments,
       bacteria were infected with phage
   radiolabeled with either 35S, which labels
  protein, or 32P, which labels DNA. Only 32P
   entered the bacterial cells, indicating that
          DNA is the genetic material.



Around this same time, Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the
content of DNA in different species and found that the amounts of adenine,
thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that
it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same
species. He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine,
and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or A = T and G =
C. This is also known as Chargaff’s rules. This finding proved immensely
useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA
double helix model.

Section Summary
DNA was first isolated from white blood cells by Friedrich Miescher, who
called it nuclein because it was isolated from nuclei. Frederick Griffith's
experiments with strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae provided the first
hint that DNA may be the transforming principle. Avery, MacLeod, and
McCarty proved that DNA is required for the transformation of bacteria.
Later experiments by Hershey and Chase using bacteriophage T2 proved
that DNA is the genetic material. Chargaff found that the ratio of A = T and
C = G, and that the percentage content of A, T, G, and C is different for
different species.

DNA Structure and Sequencing
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the structure of DNA
     Explain the Sanger method of DNA sequencing
     Discuss the similarities and differences between eukaryotic and
     prokaryotic DNA

The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides. The important components of
the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a
phosphate group ([link]). The nucleotide is named depending on the
nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (A)
and guanine (G), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (C) and thymine (T).




     Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate
   group, and a nitrogenous base. The sugar is deoxyribose
                 in DNA and ribose in RNA.



The nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as
phosphodiester bonds or linkages. The purines have a double ring structure
with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. Pyrimidines are
smaller in size; they have a single six-membered ring structure. The carbon
atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is read as
“one prime”). The phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of
the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of the
3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3'
phosphodiester bond.

In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine
the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge, England. Other
scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively
exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of
proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind
Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of
DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA
molecule on the basis of Franklin's data because Crick had also studied X-
ray diffraction ([link]). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice
Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Unfortunately, by then
Franklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.




     The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson,
    Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present
   day understanding of DNA. Scientist Rosalind Franklin
     discovered (b) the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA,
     which helped to elucidate its double helix structure.
    (credit a: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty,
                  Public Library of Science)
Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are
twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. Base pairing takes
place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, A pairs with T and G pairs
with C. Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine
and guanine are also complementary base pairs. The base pairs are
stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen
bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two
strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand faces the
5' end of the other strand. The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form
the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked
inside. Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of
0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm. Therefore, ten base
pairs are present per turn of the helix. The diameter of the DNA double
helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout. Only the pairing between a
purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter. The twisting of the
two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced
major and minor grooves ([link]).




     DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b)
    phosphodiester bonds. The (c) major and minor
      grooves are binding sites for DNA binding
  proteins during processes such as transcription (the
     copying of RNA from DNA) and replication.




DNA Sequencing Techniques
Until the 1990s, the sequencing of DNA (reading the sequence of DNA)
was a relatively expensive and long process. Using radiolabeled nucleotides
also compounded the problem through safety concerns. With currently
available technology and automated machines, the process is cheap, safer,
and can be completed in a matter of hours. Fred Sanger developed the
sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which
is widely used today ([link]).

technique that resulted from Sanger’s work.



The method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. The
sequencing method is based on the use of chain terminators, the
dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs). The dideoxynucleotides, or ddNTPSs, differ
from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' OH group on the five-
carbon sugar. If a ddNTP is added to a growing a DNA strand, the chain is
not extended any further because the free 3' OH group needed to add
another nucleotide is not available. By using a predetermined ratio of
deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate DNA
fragments of different sizes.
       In Frederick Sanger's dideoxy chain
         termination method, dye-labeled
     dideoxynucleotides are used to generate
   DNA fragments that terminate at different
   points. The DNA is separated by capillary
     electrophoresis on the basis of size, and
     from the order of fragments formed, the
      DNA sequence can be read. The DNA
         sequence readout is shown on an
  electropherogram that is generated by a laser
                     scanner.



The DNA sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two
strands by heating it to high temperatures. The DNA is divided into four
tubes in which a primer, DNA polymerase, and all four nucleotides (A, T,
G, and C) are added. In addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities
of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube respectively.
The tubes are labeled as A, T, G, and C according to the ddNTP added. For
detection purposes, each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different
fluorescent label. Chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy
nucleotide is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place.
After the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. Even a difference in
length of a single base can be detected. The sequence is read from a laser
scanner. For his work on DNA sequencing, Sanger received a Nobel Prize
in chemistry in 1980.

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments of
different sizes. Usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose.
Agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. After cooling, the gel
solution is poured into a casting tray. Once the gel has solidified, the DNA
is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. The DNA has a net
negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive
electrode. The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA
separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the
well (where the DNA was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight
fragments will be closest to the well. Once the DNA is separated, the gel is
stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it ([link]).

Neanderthal Genome: How Are We Related?
The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published
by Richard E. Green et al. in 2010.[footnote] Neanderthals are the closest
ancestors of present-day humans. They were known to have lived in
Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records
approximately 30,000 years ago. Green’s team studied almost 40,000-year-
old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world. Extremely
sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were
employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial
contamination. In their study, the scientists were able to sequence some
four billion base pairs. The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that
of present-day humans from across the world. After comparing the
sequences, the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3
percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in
Africa. While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans
can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa, the data from the
Neanderthal genome may contradict this view. Green and his colleagues
also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are
more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human
sequences. Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as
closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China
or France. This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been
located only in Europe and West Asia. Most likely, genetic exchange took
place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans
emerged out of Africa, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians,
and Papua New Guineans.
Richard E. Green et al., “A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome,”
Science 328 (2010): 710-22.
Several genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during
the evolution of present-day humans. These genes are involved in cranial
structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development. One
of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX2, which is different in
modern day humans and Neanderthals. This gene is responsible for the
prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in
Neanderthals. It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX2 was
important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the
cranium and the upper body.

DNA Packaging in Cells

When comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are
much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features ([link]). Most
prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area
of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.



Note:
Art Connection




     A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus,
    whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in
     the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.
In eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis occur in a separate
compartment from protein synthesis. In prokaryotic cells, both processes
occur together. What advantages might there be to separating the
processes? What advantages might there be to having them occur together?



The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, E.coli,
is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out).
So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by
what is known as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either
under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-
wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state.
Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins
and enzymes such as DNA gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled
structure.

Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule,
employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the
nucleus ([link]). At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins
known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The histones are
evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and
form an octamer. The DNA (which is negatively charged because of the
phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This
nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. This is
also known as the “beads on a string” structure. This is further compacted
into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. At the metaphase
stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700
nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.

In interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can
be distinguished by staining. The tightly packaged region is known as
heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin.
Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed, and is found
in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The euchromatin usually
contains genes that are transcribed, with DNA packaged around
nucleosomes but not further compacted.
   These figures illustrate the
  compaction of the eukaryotic
         chromosome.




Section Summary
The currently accepted model of the double-helix structure of DNA was
proposed by Watson and Crick. Some of the salient features are that the two
strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel
in nature. Deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the
structure, and the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. The diameter of the
double helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. A purine always pairs with a
pyrimidine; A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. One turn of the helix has
ten base pairs. During cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of
the DNA by a process known as DNA replication. Prokaryotes are much
simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. Most prokaryotes contain
a single, circular chromosome. In general, eukaryotic chromosomes contain
a linear DNA molecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct
regions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different states of
packaging and compaction.

Basics of DNA Replication
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain how the structure of DNA reveals the replication process
     Describe the Meselson and Stahl experiments

The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to
how DNA divides and makes copies of itself. This model suggests that the
two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand
serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied.
What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three
models suggested ([link]): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive.




   The three suggested models
    of DNA replication. Grey
   indicates the original DNA
   strands, and blue indicates
    newly synthesized DNA.



In conservative replication, the parental DNA remains together, and the
newly formed daughter strands are together. The semi-conservative method
suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for
new DNA to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded DNA
includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. In the
dispersive model, both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of
parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed.

Meselson and Stahl were interested in understanding how DNA replicates.
They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy”
isotope of nitrogen (15N) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and
eventually into the DNA ([link]).




     Meselson and Stahl experimented
      with E. coli grown first in heavy
      nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA
     grown in 15N (red band) is heavier
      than DNA grown in 14N (orange
   band), and sediments to a lower level
      in cesium chloride solution in an
  ultracentrifuge. When DNA grown in
    15N is switched to media containing
    14N, after one round of cell division
  the DNA sediments halfway between
  the 15N and 14N levels, indicating that
    it now contains fifty percent 14N. In
       subsequent cell divisions, an
   increasing amount of DNA contains
  14N only. This data supports the semi-
     conservative replication model.
     (credit: modification of work by
         Mariana Ruiz Villareal)



The E. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14N and
allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA
was isolated. The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge.
Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14N and spun
again. During the density gradient centrifugation, the DNA is loaded into a
gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at
high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA
will form a band according to its density in the gradient. DNA grown in 15N
will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and
Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N after they had been
shifted from 15N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in
between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N and 14N. This suggested
either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA
harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands:
one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and
the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be
explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. Therefore, the
other two modes were ruled out.

During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double
helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new
strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. When two
daughter DNA copies are formed, they have the same sequence and are
divided equally into the two daughter cells.

DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes
     Discuss the role of different enzymes and proteins in supporting this
     process

DNA replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily
because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available.
E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of
it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin
of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions. This
means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The
process is quite rapid and occurs without many mistakes.

DNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, each of
which plays a critical role during the process. One of the key players is the
enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol, which adds nucleotides
one by one to the growing DNA chain that are complementary to the
template strand. The addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy is
obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them,
similar to ATP which has three phosphate groups attached. When the bond
between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the
phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing
chain. In prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known: DNA
pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the
enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I and DNA pol II are
primarily required for repair.

How does the replication machinery know where to begin? It turns out that
there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where
replication begins. In E. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its
one chromosome (as do most prokaryotes), it is approximately 245 base
pairs long and is rich in AT sequences. The origin of replication is
recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. An enzyme called
helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the
nitrogenous base pairs. ATP hydrolysis is required for this process. As the
DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed.
Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get
extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds. Single-strand binding
proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent
the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix. DNA
polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new
DNA strand can be only extended in this direction). It also requires a free
3'-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester
bond between the 3'-OH end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide.
This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-OH group
is not available. Then how does it add the first nucleotide? The problem is
solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-OH end. Another
enzyme, RNA primase, synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten
nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA. Because this sequence
primes the DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. DNA
polymerase can now extend this RNA primer, adding nucleotides one by
one that are complementary to the template strand ([link]).

   replication. The DNA tends to become more
    highly coiled ahead of the replication fork.
    Topoisomerase breaks and reforms DNA’s
   phosphate backbone ahead of the replication
      fork, thereby relieving the pressure that
   results from this supercoiling. Single-strand
    binding proteins bind to the single-stranded
    DNA to prevent the helix from re-forming.
    Primase synthesizes an RNA primer. DNA
   polymerase III uses this primer to synthesize
     the daughter DNA strand. On the leading
     strand, DNA is synthesized continuously,
       whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is
   synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki
    fragments. DNA polymerase I replaces the
     RNA primer with DNA. DNA ligase seals
     the gaps between the Okazaki fragments,
      joining the fragments into a single DNA
    molecule. (credit: modification of work by
               Mariana Ruiz Villareal)


You isolate a cell strain in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments
is impaired and suspect that a mutation has occurred in an enzyme found at
the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated?



The replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA
polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, which poses a slight
problem at the replication fork. As we know, the DNA double helix is anti-
parallel; that is, one strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is
oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. One strand, which is complementary to the
3' to 5' parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously towards the
replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this
direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading
strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental DNA, is
extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as
Okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. Okazaki
fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them.
The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand.
The leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the
lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments.
The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the
leading strand 5' to 3'. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA
polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is
a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in
place. Topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the DNA double helix
ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by
causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As
synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are
removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA pol I, and the gaps are filled
in by deoxyribonucleotides. The nicks that remain between the newly
synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously
synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the
formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-OH end of one
nucleotide and the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment.

Once the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two DNA copies
move into two different cells during cell division. The process of DNA
replication can be summarized as follows:

  1. DNA unwinds at the origin of replication.
  2. Helicase opens up the DNA-forming replication forks; these are
     extended bidirectionally.
  3. Single-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication
     fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.
  4. Topoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to
     prevent supercoiling.
  5. Primase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.
  6. DNA polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the
     primer.
  7. Elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues.
  8. RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity.
  9. Gaps are filled by DNA pol by adding dNTPs.
 10. The gap between the two DNA fragments is sealed by DNA ligase,
     which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.

Section Summary
Replication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome
called the origin of replication—the point at which the DNA opens up.
Helicase opens up the DNA double helix, resulting in the formation of the
replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded
DNA near the replication fork to keep the fork open. Primase synthesizes an
RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add
nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. One strand is synthesized
continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the
leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the
replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments.
This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed,
the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed
with DNA ligase, which creates phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-OH of
one end and the 5' phosphate of the other strand.

DNA Replication in Eukaryotes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Discuss the similarities and differences between DNA replication in
     eukaryotes and prokaryotes
     State the role of telomerase in DNA replication

Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than
prokaryotic genomes. The human genome has three billion base pairs per
haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during
the S phase of the cell cycle. There are multiple origins of replication on the
eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of
replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per
second, much slower than prokaryotic replication. In yeast, which is a
eukaryote, special sequences known as Autonomously Replicating
Sequences (ARS) are found on the chromosomes. These are equivalent to
the origin of replication in E. coli.

The number of DNA polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than
prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles
during replication and have been well studied. They are known as pol α, pol
β, pol γ, pol δ, and pol ε.

The essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. Before
replication can start, the DNA has to be made available as template.
Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form
structures called nucleosomes. The chromatin (the complex between DNA
and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the DNA
may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the
DNA replication machinery. At the origin of replication, a pre-replication
complex is made with other initiator proteins. Other proteins are then
recruited to start the replication process ([link]).

A helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix.
Replication forks are formed at each replication origin as the DNA
unwinds. The opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or
supercoiling, in the DNA ahead of the replication fork. These are resolved
with the action of topoisomerases. Primers are formed by the enzyme
primase, and using the primer, DNA pol can start synthesis. While the
leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol δ, the lagging
strand is synthesized by pol ε. A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA
(Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) holds the DNA pol in place so that it
does not slide off the DNA. RNase H removes the RNA primer, which is
then replaced with DNA nucleotides. The Okazaki fragments in the lagging
strand are joined together after the replacement of the RNA primers with
DNA. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase, which forms the
phosphodiester bond.

Telomere replication
Unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. As
you’ve learned, the enzyme DNA pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to
3' direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the
chromosome is reached. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short
stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the
replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place
for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the
chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends
may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide.

The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have
repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. In a way, these
telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide.
In humans, a six base pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000
times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase ([link]) helped in the
understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase
enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to
the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template
are added on the 3' end of the DNA strand. Once the 3' end of the lagging
strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the
nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends
of the chromosomes are replicated.
         The ends of linear
  chromosomes are maintained by
    the action of the telomerase
              enzyme.



Telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. It is not
active in adult somatic cells. For her discovery of telomerase and its action,
Elizabeth Blackburn ([link]) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and
Physiology in 2009.
  Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel
     Laureate, is the scientist who
  discovered how telomerase works.

Telomerase and Aging

Cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened
because most somatic cells do not make telomerase. This essentially means
that telomere shortening is associated with aging. With the advent of
modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the
human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people
to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older.

In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related
conditions in mice. This may have potential in regenerative medicine.
[footnote] Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice

have tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired
tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused
extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration,
and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus,
telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in
humans.
Jaskelioff et al., “Telomerase reactivation reverses tissue degeneration in
aged telomerase-deficient mice,” Nature 469 (2011): 102-7.

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. The
cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to
different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. Scientists
have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres
and that telomerase is active in these cells. Interestingly, only after the
telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become
active. If the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs
during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped
from further division.

Section Summary
Replication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication. The
mechanism is quite similar to prokaryotes. A primer is required to initiate
synthesis, which is then extended by DNA polymerase as it adds
nucleotides one by one to the growing chain. The leading strand is
synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short
stretches called Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are replaced with
DNA nucleotides; the DNA remains one continuous strand by linking the
DNA fragments with DNA ligase. The ends of the chromosomes pose a
problem as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer.
Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by
copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome.
DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way,
the ends of the chromosomes are protected.

DNA Repair
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Discuss the different types of mutations in DNA
     Explain DNA repair mechanisms

DNA replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally
occur, such as a DNA polymerase inserting a wrong base. Uncorrected
mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer.
Repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. In rare cases, mistakes are not
corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are
themselves mutated or defective.

Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by
DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ([link]).
In proofreading, the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding
the next one, so a correction can be made. The polymerase checks whether
the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template
strand. If it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. If an incorrect
base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond
and releases the wrong nucleotide. This is performed by the exonuclease
action of DNA pol III. Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a
new one will be added again.




  Proofreading by DNA polymerase
  corrects errors during replication.



Some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected
after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as mismatch
repair ([link]). The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and
excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base. If this remains
uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. How do mismatch
repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? In E.
coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl
group; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups, whereas the
newly synthesized strand lacks them. Thus, DNA polymerase is able to
remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-
methylated strand. In eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well
understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the
new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the
replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has
completed.




   In mismatch repair, the
  incorrectly added base is
  detected after replication.
    The mismatch repair
   proteins detect this base
   and remove it from the
  newly synthesized strand
   by nuclease action. The
  gap is now filled with the
    correctly paired base.
In another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes
replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the
incorrect base ([link]). The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with
the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol. Once the bases
are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage
catalyzed by DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is often employed when
UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers.




  Nucleotide excision
    repairs thymine
      dimers. When
    exposed to UV,
     thymines lying
    adjacent to each
     other can form
  thymine dimers. In
   normal cells, they
    are excised and
        replaced.



A well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people
suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa ([link]). Affected individuals have
skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun. When individuals are
exposed to UV, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed;
people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. These
are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair
enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised
and the defect is corrected. The thymine dimers distort the structure of the
DNA double helix, and this may cause problems during DNA replication.
People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting
skin cancer than those who dont have the condition.




      Xeroderma pigmentosa is a
      condition in which thymine
  dimerization from exposure to UV
      is not repaired. Exposure to
    sunlight results in skin lesions.
     (credit: James Halpern et al.)



Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise
in DNA. Mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can
also occur because of damage to DNA. Such mutations may be of two
types: induced or spontaneous. Induced mutations are those that result
from an exposure to chemicals, UV rays, x-rays, or some other
environmental agent. Spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure
to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking
place within the body.
Mutations may have a wide range of effects. Some mutations are not
expressed; these are known as silent mutations. Point mutations are those
mutations that affect a single base pair. The most common nucleotide
mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. These
can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. Transition
substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the
same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the
purine guanine. Transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced
by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is
replaced by adenine, a purine. Mutations can also be the result of the
addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also
known as deletion. Sometimes a piece of DNA from one chromosome may
get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same
chromosome; this is also known as translocation. These mutation types are
shown in [link].



Note:
Art Connection
    Mutations can lead to changes in
    the protein sequence encoded by
                the DNA.


A frameshift mutation that results in the insertion of three nucleotides is
often less deleterious than a mutation that results in the insertion of one
nucleotide. Why?



Mutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. Many mutated
repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer,
colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. Mutations can affect either somatic
cells or germ cells. If many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they
may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in
cancer. If a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed
on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma
pigmentosa.

Section Summary
DNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. It edits the
DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed
and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. Most
mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not
happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair
enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the
DNA, replacing it with the correct base. In yet another type of repair,
nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is removed along with a few
bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced by copying the template
with the help of DNA polymerase. The ends of the newly synthesized
fragment are attached to the rest of the DNA using DNA ligase, which
creates a phosphodiester bond.

Most mistakes are corrected, and if they are not, they may result in a
mutation defined as a permanent change in the DNA sequence. Mutations
can be of many types, such as substitution, deletion, insertion, and
translocation. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences
such as cancer. Mutations can be induced or may occur spontaneously.

Since the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, the definition of the gene
has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular
entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation ([link]). Genes are
composed of DNA and are linearly arranged on chromosomes. Genes
specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of
proteins. In turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every
function of the cell. Both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely
essential to life as we know it.
The Genetic Code
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain the “central dogma” of protein synthesis
     Describe the genetic code and how the nucleotide sequence prescribes
     the amino acid and the protein sequence

The cellular process of transcription generates messenger RNA (mRNA), a
mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of A, C, G,
and uracil (U). Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-
based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist
of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the
protein alphabet consists of 20 letters ([link]). Each amino acid is defined
by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. Different amino
acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and
nonpolar) and different structural constraints. Variation in amino acid
sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function.
    Structures of the 20 amino acids found in proteins are
   shown. Each amino acid is composed of an amino group
      (NH ), a carboxyl group (COO-), and a side chain
          +
          3

       (blue). The side chain may be nonpolar, polar, or
     charged, as well as large or small. It is the variety of
    amino acid side chains that gives rise to the incredible
          variation of protein structure and function.




The Central Dogma: DNA Encodes RNA; RNA Encodes
Protein
The flow of genetic information in cells from DNA to mRNA to protein is
described by the Central Dogma ([link]), which states that genes specify
the sequence of mRNAs, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins.
The decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins
and RNAs. Because the information stored in DNA is so central to cellular
function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mRNA copies of
this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the DNA itself intact
and protected. The copying of DNA to RNA is relatively straightforward,
with one nucleotide being added to the mRNA strand for every nucleotide
read in the DNA strand. The translation to protein is a bit more complex
because three mRNA nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the
polypeptide sequence. However, the translation to protein is still systematic
and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1,
nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on.
     Instructions on DNA are
   transcribed onto messenger
  RNA. Ribosomes are able to
  read the genetic information
      inscribed on a strand of
  messenger RNA and use this
  information to string amino
  acids together into a protein.




The Genetic Code Is Degenerate and Universal
Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein
“alphabets,” scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides
corresponded to single amino acids. Nucleotide doublets would not be
sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible
two-nucleotide combinations (42). In contrast, there are 64 possible
nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids.
Scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets
and that the genetic code was degenerate. In other words, a given amino
acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. This was later
confirmed experimentally; Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner used the
chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the
gene of a virus. When one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein
synthesis was completely abolished. When three nucleotides were inserted,
the protein was synthesized and functional. This demonstrated that three
nucleotides specify each amino acid. These nucleotide triplets are called
codons. The insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the
triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent
amino acid ([link]). Though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra
amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the
protein was maintained.

Scientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic
mRNAs in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified ([link]).
    This figure shows the genetic
      code for translating each
  nucleotide triplet in mRNA into
   an amino acid or a termination
     signal in a nascent protein.

                 NIH)



In addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a
polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and
release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. These triplets are
called nonsense codons, or stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a
special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also
serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for
translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5' end of the mRNA.

The genetic code is universal. With a few exceptions, virtually all species
use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. Conservation of codons
means that a purified mRNA encoding the globin protein in horses could be
transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. That
there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on Earth
shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084
possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons.

  The deletion of two nucleotides shifts
   the reading frame of an mRNA and
   changes the entire protein message,
   creating a nonfunctional protein or
      terminating protein synthesis
                altogether.



Degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative
impact of random mutations. Codons that specify the same amino acid
typically only differ by one nucleotide. In addition, amino acids with
chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. This nuance
of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation
might either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a
similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely
nonfunctional.

Scientific Method Connection
Which Has More DNA: A Kiwi or a Strawberry?
   Do you think that a kiwi or a strawberry has more
    DNA per fruit? (credit “kiwi”: "Kelbv"/Flickr;
      credit: “strawberry”: Alisdair McDiarmid)


Question: Would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the
same size ([link]) also have approximately the same amount of DNA?
Background: Genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of DNA.
All mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each
chromosome. However, not all plants are diploid. The common strawberry
is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n). Research the
total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think
about how this might correspond to the amount of DNA in these fruits’ cell
nuclei. Read about the technique of DNA isolation to understand how each
step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate DNA.
Hypothesis: Hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference
in DNA quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis. Which fruit
do you think would yield more DNA?
Test your hypothesis: Isolate the DNA from a strawberry and a kiwi that
are similarly sized. Perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each
fruit.

  1. Prepare a bottle of DNA extraction buffer from 900 mL water, 50 mL
     dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt. Mix by inversion (cap
     it and turn it upside down a few times).
  2. Grind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a
     mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt
     instrument. Grind for at least two minutes per fruit.
  3. Add 10 mL of the DNA extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well
     for at least one minute.
  4. Remove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through
     cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or
     an appropriate container.
  5. Pour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test
     tube. You should observe white, precipitated DNA.
  6. Gather the DNA from each fruit by winding it around separate glass
     rods.

Record your observations: Because you are not quantitatively measuring
DNA volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits
produced the same or different amounts of DNA as observed by eye. If one
or the other fruit produced noticeably more DNA, record this as well.
Determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of
each fruit.
Analyze your data: Did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of
DNA produced by each fruit? Were your results reproducible?
Draw a conclusion: Given what you know about the number of
chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number
necessarily correlates to DNA amount? Can you identify any drawbacks to
this procedure? If you had access to a laboratory, how could you
standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative?



Section Summary
The genetic code refers to the DNA alphabet (A, T, C, G), the RNA
alphabet (A, U, C, G), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). The
Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from
genes to mRNA to proteins. Genes are used to make mRNA by the process
of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of
translation. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in
mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. Almost
every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.

  Solution:

  For 200 commonly occurring amino acids, codons consisting of four
  types of nucleotides would have to be at least four nucleotides long,

Prokaryotic Transcription
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     List the different steps in prokaryotic transcription
     Discuss the role of promoters in prokaryotic transcription
     Describe how and when transcription is terminated

The prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-
celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other
organelles. A bacterial chromosome is a covalently closed circle that, unlike
eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The
central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the
nucleoid. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are
shorter circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes.
Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome
during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance.

Transcription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the DNA double
helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis. The region of
unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds
from the same DNA strand for each gene, which is called the template
strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is
almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand.
The only difference is that in mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced
with U nucleotides. In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two
hydrogen bonds, just as in A–T pairing in a DNA double helix.

The nucleotide pair in the DNA double helix that corresponds to the site
from which the first 5' mRNA nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site,
or the initiation site. Nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given
negative numbers and are designated upstream. Conversely, nucleotides
following the initiation site are denoted with “+” numbering and are called
downstream nucleotides.

Initiation of Transcription in Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. Therefore, the
processes of transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation can all occur
simultaneously. The intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be
amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring
concurrently on the same DNA template. Prokaryotic transcription often
covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mRNAs that specify
more than one protein.

Our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process
in Escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial species. Although some
differences exist between transcription in E. coli and transcription in
archaea, an understanding of E. coli transcription can be applied to virtually
all bacterial species.



Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase

Prokaryotes use the same RNA polymerase to transcribe all of their genes.
In E. coli, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of
which are identical. Four of these subunits, denoted α, α, β, and β' comprise
the polymerase core enzyme. These subunits assemble every time a gene is
transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each
subunit has a unique role; the two α-subunits are necessary to assemble the
polymerase on the DNA; the β-subunit binds to the ribonucleoside
triphosphate that will become part of the nascent “recently born” mRNA
molecule; and the β' binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, σ, is
involved only in transcription initiation. It confers transcriptional specificity
such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mRNA from an appropriate
initiation site. Without σ, the core enzyme would transcribe from random
sites and would produce mRNA molecules that specified protein gibberish.
The polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme.



Prokaryotic Promoters
A promoter is a DNA sequence onto which the transcription machinery
binds and initiates transcription. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of
the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very
important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is
transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although
promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved.
At the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two
promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all
promoters and across various bacterial species ([link]). The -10 consensus
sequence, called the -10 region, is TATAAT. The -35 sequence, TTGACA,
is recognized and bound by σ. Once this interaction is made, the subunits of
the core enzyme bind to the site. The A–T-rich -10 region facilitates
unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are
made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of
abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides
that are made and released.




    The σ subunit of prokaryotic RNA
    polymerase recognizes consensus
     sequences found in the promoter
   region upstream of the transcription
   start sight. The σ subunit dissociates
         from the polymerase after
      transcription has been initiated.

and the base sequence repetition of the TATA box.



Elongation and Termination in Prokaryotes
The transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the σ subunit
from the polymerase. The dissociation of σ allows the core enzyme to
proceed along the DNA template, synthesizing mRNA in the 5' to 3'
direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. As
elongation proceeds, the DNA is continuously unwound ahead of the core
enzyme and rewound behind it ([link]). The base pairing between DNA and
RNA is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mRNA synthesis
components. Instead, the RNA polymerase acts as a stable linker between
the DNA template and the nascent RNA strands to ensure that elongation is
not interrupted prematurely.
 During elongation, the prokaryotic RNA
polymerase tracks along the DNA template,
   synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and
     unwinds and rewinds the DNA as it is read.




Prokaryotic Termination Signals
Once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be
instructed to dissociate from the DNA template and liberate the newly made
mRNA. Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of
termination signals. One is protein-based and the other is RNA-based. Rho-
dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along
behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the
gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA
template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the
polymerase. The interaction with rho releases the mRNA from the
transcription bubble.

Rho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the
DNA template strand. As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being
transcribed, it encounters a region rich in C–G nucleotides. The mRNA
folds back on itself, and the complementary C–G nucleotides bind together.
The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as
it begins to transcribe a region rich in A–T nucleotides. The complementary
U–A region of the mRNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the
template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough
instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mRNA
transcript.

Upon termination, the process of transcription is complete. By the time
termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used
to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these
processes can occur concurrently. The unification of transcription,
translation, and even mRNA degradation is possible because all of these
processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no
membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell ([link]). In
contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes
simultaneous transcription and translation.




  Multiple polymerases can transcribe a
  single bacterial gene while numerous
  ribosomes concurrently translate the
  mRNA transcripts into polypeptides.
    In this way, a specific protein can
  rapidly reach a high concentration in
             the bacterial cell.

Section Summary
In prokaryotes, mRNA synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the
DNA template comprising two consensus sequences that recruit RNA
polymerase. The prokaryotic polymerase consists of a core enzyme of four
protein subunits and a σ protein that assists only with initiation. Elongation
synthesizes mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of 40 nucleotides per
second. Termination liberates the mRNA and occurs either by rho protein
interaction or by the formation of an mRNA hairpin.

  Problem:

  In your own words, describe the difference between rho-dependent and
  rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes.

  Solution:

  Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which
  tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near
  the end of the gene, the polymerase stalls at a run of G nucleotides on
  the DNA template. The rho protein collides with the polymerase and
  releases mRNA from the transcription bubble. Rho-independent
  termination is controlled by specific sequences in the DNA template
  strand. As the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed,
  it encounters a region rich in C–G nucleotides. This creates an mRNA
  hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall right as it begins to
  transcribe a region rich in A–T nucleotides. Because A–U bonds are
  less thermostable, the core enzyme falls away.

Eukaryotic Transcription
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     List the steps in eukaryotic transcription
     Discuss the role of RNA polymerases in transcription
     Compare and contrast the three RNA polymerases
     Explain the significance of transcription factors

Prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of
transcription, with a few key differences. The most important difference
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latter’s membrane-bound
nucleus and organelles. With the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic
cell must be able to transport its mRNA to the cytoplasm and must protect
its mRNA from degrading before it is translated. Eukaryotes also employ
three different polymerases that each transcribe a different subset of genes.
Eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a
single protein.

Initiation of Transcription in Eukaryotes
Unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a DNA template on its
own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called transcription factors,
to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate
polymerase.



The Three Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases

The features of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis are markedly more complex
those of prokaryotes. Instead of a single polymerase comprising five
subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of
10 subunits or more. Each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set
of transcription factors to bring it to the DNA template.

RNA polymerase I is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear
substructure in which ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed, processed,
and assembled into ribosomes ([link]). The rRNA molecules are considered
structural RNAs because they have a cellular role but are not translated into
protein. The rRNAs are components of the ribosome and are essential to the
process of translation. RNA polymerase I synthesizes all of the rRNAs
except for the 5S rRNA molecule. The “S” designation applies to
“Svedberg” units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which
a particle sediments during centrifugation.

coding nuclear pre-mRNAs. Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs undergo extensive
processing after transcription but before translation. For clarity, this
module’s discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use
the term “mRNAs” to describe only the mature, processed molecules that
are ready to be translated. RNA polymerase II is responsible for
transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes.

RNA polymerase III is also located in the nucleus. This polymerase
transcribes a variety of structural RNAs that includes the 5S pre-rRNA,
transfer pre-RNAs (pre-tRNAs), and small nuclear pre-RNAs. The tRNAs
have a critical role in translation; they serve as the adaptor molecules
between the mRNA template and the growing polypeptide chain. Small
nuclear RNAs have a variety of functions, including “splicing” pre-mRNAs
and regulating transcription factors.

A scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase
transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in the presence of a
particular mushroom poison, α-amanitin ([link]). Interestingly, α-amanitin
produced by Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap mushroom, affects the
three polymerases very differently. RNA polymerase I is completely
insensitive to α-amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe DNA
in vitro in the presence of this poison. In contrast, RNA polymerase II is
extremely sensitive to α-amanitin, and RNA polymerase III is moderately
sensitive. Knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into
the general function of the gene being studied. Because RNA polymerase II
transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in
our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and
promoters.



Structure of an RNA Polymerase II Promoter

Eukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic
promoters, but both have a TATA box. For example, in the mouse thymidine
kinase gene, the TATA box is located at approximately -30 relative to the
initiation (+1) site ([link]). For this gene, the exact TATA box sequence is
TATAAAA, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the nontemplate strand. This
sequence is not identical to the E. coli TATA box, but it conserves the A–T
rich element. The thermostability of A–T bonds is low and this helps the
DNA template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription.

  polymerase II then binds and

       Eukaryotic mRNA contains

                  added.


A scientist splices a eukaryotic promoter in front of a bacterial gene and
inserts the gene in a bacterial chromosome. Would you expect the bacteria
to transcribe the gene?



The mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for
cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. Pseudogenes are genes that have lost their
protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. These
pseudogenes are copied from mRNA and incorporated into the
chromosome. For example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a
conserved CAAT box (GGCCAATCT) at approximately -80. This
sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors.
Further upstream of the TATA box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain
one or more GC-rich boxes (GGCG) or octamer boxes (ATTTGCAT).
These elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of
transcription initiation and are often identified in more “active” genes that
are constantly being expressed by the cell.



Transcription Factors for RNA Polymerase II
The complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the
polymerases and promoters. An army of basal transcription factors,
enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-
mRNA is synthesized from a gene. Enhancers and silencers affect the
efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed.
Basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation
complex on the DNA template that subsequently recruits RNA polymerase
II for transcription initiation.

The names of the basal transcription factors begin with “TFII” (this is the
transcription factor for RNA polymerase II) and are specified with the
letters A–J. The transcription factors systematically fall into place on the
DNA template, with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex
and contributing to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.

The processes of bringing RNA polymerases I and III to the DNA template
involve slightly less complex collections of transcription factors, but the
general theme is the same. Eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated
process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and
with the DNA strand. Although the process of transcription in eukaryotes
involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that
the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mRNAs that it needs for protein
synthesis.



Note:
Evolution Connection
The Evolution of Promoters
The evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. Mutations can occur in
genes during DNA replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial
to the cell. By altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor,
the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features.
However, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may
evolve as well. For instance, consider a gene that, over many generations,
becomes more valuable to the cell. Maybe the gene encodes a structural
protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function.
If this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that gene’s promoter
to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene
expression.
Scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported
varying results. In part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a
eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. Some promoters occur within genes;
others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes
they are regulating. However, when researchers limited their examination
to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as
sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters
evolve even faster than protein-coding genes.
It is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution
of humans or other higher organisms. However, the evolution of a
promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an
intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.[footnote]

Molecular Biology and Evolution 25 (2008): 1239–44.



Promoter Structures for RNA Polymerases I and III

In eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed
by RNA polymerases I, II, and III. RNA polymerase I transcribes genes that
have two GC-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. These
sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but
promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105
upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. Genes that are
transcribed by RNA polymerase III have upstream promoters or promoters
that occur within the genes themselves.

Eukaryotic Elongation and Termination
Following the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is
released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to
proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-
mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction. As discussed previously, RNA polymerase
II transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus
on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination.

Although the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in
eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the DNA template is more complex. When
eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of DNA
and proteins called chromatin. The DNA is tightly packaged around
charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. These DNA–histone
complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and
include 146 nucleotides of DNA wound around eight histones like thread
around a spool.

For polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to
move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome. This
is accomplished by a special protein complex called FACT, which stands
for “facilitates chromatin transcription.” This complex pulls histones away
from the DNA template as the polymerase moves along it. Once the pre-
mRNA is synthesized, the FACT complex replaces the histones to recreate
the nucleosomes.

The termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases.
Unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes
takes place 1,000–2,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being
transcribed. This pre-mRNA tail is subsequently removed by cleavage
during mRNA processing. On the other hand, RNA polymerases I and III
require termination signals. Genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I
contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a
termination protein. The process of termination in RNA polymerase III
involves an mRNA hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of
transcription in prokaryotes.

Section Summary
Transcription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of polymerases,
depending on the gene being transcribed. RNA polymerase II transcribes all
of the protein-coding genes, whereas RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNA
genes, and RNA polymerase III transcribes rRNA, tRNA, and small nuclear
RNA genes. The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes involves the
binding of several transcription factors to complex promoter sequences that
are usually located upstream of the gene being copied. The mRNA is
synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, and the FACT complex moves and
reassembles nucleosomes as the polymerase passes by. Whereas RNA
polymerases I and III terminate transcription by protein- or RNA hairpin-
dependent methods, RNA polymerase II transcribes for 1,000 or more
nucleotides beyond the gene template and cleaves the excess during pre-
mRNA processing.

RNA Processing in Eukaryotes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the different steps in RNA processing
     Understand the significance of exons, introns, and splicing
     Explain how tRNAs and rRNAs are processed

After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo several
processing steps before they can be translated. Eukaryotic (and prokaryotic)
tRNAs and rRNAs also undergo processing before they can function as
components in the protein synthesis machinery.

mRNA Processing
The eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes extensive processing before it is
ready to be translated. The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA
maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a
prokaryotic mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the
typical E. coli mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.

Pre-mRNAs are first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins; these protect the
pre-mRNA from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the
nucleus. The three most important steps of pre-mRNA processing are the
addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the
molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the
appropriate amino acids. In rare cases, the mRNA transcript can be “edited”
after it is transcribed.



Note:
Evolution Connection
RNA Editing in Trypanosomes
The trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen
Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in humans ([link]).
Trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called
mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. Mitochondria are
organelles that express their own DNA and are believed to be the remnants
of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed
prokaryote. The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes exhibit an
interesting exception to The Central Dogma: their pre-mRNAs do not have
the correct information to specify a functional protein. Usually, this is
because the mRNA is missing several U nucleotides. The cell performs an
additional RNA processing step called RNA editing to remedy this.




    Trypanosoma brucei is
    the causative agent of
     sleeping sickness in
   humans. The mRNAs of
    this pathogen must be
   modified by the addition
     of nucleotides before
     protein synthesis can
         occur. (credit:
   modification of work by
    Torsten Ochsenreiter)


Other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide
guide RNAs. One or more of these molecules interacts by complementary
base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mRNA transcript.
However, the guide RNA has more A nucleotides than the pre-mRNA has
U nucleotides to bind with. In these regions, the guide RNA loops out. The
3' ends of guide RNAs have a long poly-U tail, and these U bases are
inserted in regions of the pre-mRNA transcript at which the guide RNAs
are looped. This process is entirely mediated by RNA molecules. That is,
guide RNAs—rather than proteins—serve as the catalysts in RNA editing.
RNA editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. In the
mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mRNAs are edited. RNA
editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even
humans. What could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in
pre-mRNA processing? One possibility is that the mitochondria, being
remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient RNA-based
method for regulating gene expression. In support of this hypothesis, edits
made to pre-mRNAs differ depending on cellular conditions. Although
speculative, the process of RNA editing may be a holdover from a
primordial time when RNA molecules, instead of proteins, were
responsible for catalyzing reactions.



5' Capping

While the pre-mRNA is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap
is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage. This
moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mRNA from degradation. In
addition, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help
initiate translation by ribosomes.



3' Poly-A Tail

Once elongation is complete, the pre-mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease
between an AAUAAA consensus sequence and a GU-rich sequence,
leaving the AAUAAA sequence on the pre-mRNA. An enzyme called poly-
A polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 A residues, called
the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from
degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript
needs to the cytoplasm.
Pre-mRNA Splicing

Eukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-
coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are expressed), and intervening
sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role), which may
be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre-mRNA during
processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins.

The discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who
expected that pre-mRNAs would specify protein sequences without further
processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. The genes of higher
eukaryotes very often contain one or more introns. These regions may
correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of
having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. It is
possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes longer to
transcribe pre-mRNAs with lots of introns. Alternatively, introns may be
nonfunctional sequence remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes
throughout evolution. This is supported by the fact that separate exons often
encode separate protein subunits or domains. For the most part, the
sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately affecting the protein
product.

All of a pre-mRNA’s introns must be completely and precisely removed
before protein synthesis. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the
reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein
would be dysfunctional. The process of removing introns and reconnecting
exons is called splicing ([link]). Introns are removed and degraded while
the pre-mRNA is still in the nucleus. Splicing occurs by a sequence-specific
mechanism that ensures introns will be removed and exons rejoined with
the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. The splicing of pre-
mRNAs is conducted by complexes of proteins and RNA molecules called
spliceosomes.



Note:
Art Connection
   Pre-mRNA splicing involves
  the precise removal of introns
      from the primary RNA
      transcript. The splicing
      process is catalyzed by
     protein complexes called
       spliceosomes that are
     composed of proteins and
       RNA molecules called
      snRNAs. Spliceosomes
   recognize sequences at the 5'
      and 3' end of the intron.

What kinds of mutations might lead to splicing errors? Think of different
possible outcomes if splicing errors occur.



Note that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to
undergo the process of splicing—in addition to 5' capping and the addition
of a poly-A tail—just to generate a single, translatable mRNA molecule.

Processing of tRNAs and rRNAs
The tRNAs and rRNAs are structural molecules that have roles in protein
synthesis; however, these RNAs are not themselves translated. Pre-rRNAs
are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus.
Pre-tRNAs are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released
into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein
synthesis.

Most of the tRNAs and rRNAs in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first
transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans multiple rRNAs or
tRNAs. Enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to
each structural RNA. Some of the bases of pre-rRNAs are methylated; that
is, a –CH3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability. Pre-
tRNA molecules also undergo methylation. As with pre-mRNAs, subunit
excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-RNAs destined to become tRNAs or
rRNAs.

Mature rRNAs make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. Some
of a ribosome’s RNA molecules are purely structural, whereas others have
catalytic or binding activities. Mature tRNAs take on a three-dimensional
structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino
acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end ([link]). The
anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a tRNA that interacts with an
mRNA codon through complementary base pairing.




  This is a space-filling model of
  a tRNA molecule that adds the
   amino acid phenylalanine to a
  growing polypeptide chain. The
     anticodon AAG binds the
  Codon UUC on the mRNA. The
    amino acid phenylalanine is
  attached to the other end of the
               tRNA.
Section Summary
Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are modified with a 5' methylguanosine cap and a
poly-A tail. These structures protect the mature mRNA from degradation
and help export it from the nucleus. Pre-mRNAs also undergo splicing, in
which introns are removed and exons are reconnected with single-
nucleotide accuracy. Only finished mRNAs that have undergone 5' capping,
3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing are exported from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. Pre-rRNAs and pre-tRNAs may be processed by intramolecular
cleavage, splicing, methylation, and chemical conversion of nucleotides.
Rarely, RNA editing is also performed to insert missing bases after an
mRNA has been synthesized.

Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the different steps in protein synthesis
     Discuss the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis

The synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cell’s energy than any other
metabolic process. In turn, proteins account for more mass than any other
component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins
perform virtually every function of a cell. The process of translation, or
protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mRNA message into a
polypeptide product. Amino acids are covalently strung together by
interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino
acid residues to more than 1,000. Each individual amino acid has an amino
group (NH2) and a carboxyl (COOH) group. Polypeptides are formed when
the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with
the carboxyl group of another amino acid ([link]). This reaction is catalyzed
by ribosomes and generates one water molecule.




     A peptide bond links the
    carboxyl end of one amino
    acid with the amino end of
   another, expelling one water
    molecule. For simplicity in
       this image, only the
  functional groups involved in
   the peptide bond are shown.
    The R and R' designations
  refer to the rest of each amino
           acid structure.


The Protein Synthesis Machinery
In addition to the mRNA template, many molecules and macromolecules
contribute to the process of translation. The composition of each component
may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different
numbers of rRNAs and polypeptides depending on the organism. However,
the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are
comparable from bacteria to human cells. Translation requires the input of
an mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors.

Ribosomes

Even before an mRNA is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each
of its ribosomes. In E. coli, there are between 10,000 and 70,000 ribosomes
present in each cell at any given time. A ribosome is a complex
macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many
distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized
for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.
Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and
rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts
also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more
similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than
the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.
Ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not
synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. In
E. coli, the small subunit is described as 30S, and the large subunit is 50S,
for a total of 70S (recall that Svedberg units are not additive). Mammalian
ribosomes have a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit, for a total of
80S. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template,
whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs. Each mRNA molecule
is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in
the same direction: reading the mRNA from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the
polypeptide from the N terminus to the C terminus. The complete
mRNA/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome.



tRNAs

The tRNAs are structural RNA molecules that were transcribed from genes
by RNA polymerase III. Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNAs
exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to
sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to
the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually
“translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins.

Of the 64 possible mRNA codons—or triplet combinations of A, U, G, and
C—three specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the
addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. Of these 61, one codon
(AUG) also encodes the initiation of translation. Each tRNA anticodon can
base pair with one of the mRNA codons and add an amino acid or terminate
translation, according to the genetic code. For instance, if the sequence
CUA occurred on an mRNA template in the proper reading frame, it would
bind a tRNA expressing the complementary sequence, GAU, which would
be linked to the amino acid leucine.
As the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that tRNAs can fit
so much specificity into such a small package. Consider that tRNAs need to
interact with three factors: 1) they must be recognized by the correct
aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by
ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mRNA.



Aminoacyl tRNA Synthetases

The process of pre-tRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase III only creates the
RNA portion of the adaptor molecule. The corresponding amino acid must
be added later, once the tRNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm.
Through the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is linked to
its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases. At least one type of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase exists for
each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases varies by species. These enzymes first bind and hydrolyze ATP
to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine
monophosphate (AMP); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this
reaction. The activated amino acid is then transferred to the tRNA, and
AMP is released.

The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis
As with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three
phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The process of translation is
similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we’ll explore how translation
occurs in E. coli, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences
between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.



Initiation of Translation

Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In E.
coli, this complex involves the small 30S ribosome, the mRNA template,
three initiation factors (IFs; IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), and a special initiator
tRNA, called tRNA . The initiator tRNA interacts with the start codon
                     Met
                     f

AUG (or rarely, GUG), links to a formylated methionine called fMet, and
can also bind IF-2. Formylated methionine is inserted by f Met − tRNA     Met

                                                                          f

at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by E. coli, but it is
usually clipped off after translation is complete. When an in-frame AUG is
encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is
inserted by a regular Met-tRNAMet.

In E. coli mRNA, a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon, called the
Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG), interacts with the rRNA molecules
that compose the ribosome. This interaction anchors the 30S ribosomal
subunit at the correct location on the mRNA template. Guanosine
triphosphate (GTP), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an
energy source during translation—both at the start of elongation and during
the ribosome’s translocation.

In eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mRNA, the
40S small ribosomal subunit, IFs, and nucleoside triphosphates (GTP and
ATP). The charged initiator tRNA, called Met-tRNAi, does not bind fMet in
eukaryotes, but is distinct from other Met-tRNAs in that it can bind IFs.

Instead of depositing at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic
initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the
mRNA. A cap-binding protein (CBP) and several other IFs assist the
movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. Once at the cap, the initiation
complex tracks along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the
AUG start codon. Many eukaryotic mRNAs are translated from the first
AUG, but this is not always the case. According to Kozak’s rules, the
nucleotides around the AUG indicate whether it is the correct start codon.
Kozak’s rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear
around the AUG of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccRccAUGG-3'. The R (for
purine) indicates a site that can be either A or G, but cannot be C or U.
Essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the
efficiency of translation.

Once the appropriate AUG is identified, the other proteins and CBP
dissociate, and the 60S subunit binds to the complex of Met-tRNAi, mRNA,
and the 40S subunit. This step completes the initiation of translation in
eukaryotes.



Translation, Elongation, and Termination

In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we
will review elongation from the perspective of E. coli. The 50S ribosomal
subunit of E. coli consists of three compartments: the A (aminoacyl) site
binds incoming charged aminoacyl tRNAs. The P (peptidyl) site binds
charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with
the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their
corresponding tRNA. The E (exit) site releases dissociated tRNAs so that
they can be recharged with free amino acids. There is one exception to this
assembly line of tRNAs: in E. coli, f Met − tRNA      Met
                                                      f
                                                          is capable of
entering the P site directly without first entering the A site. Similarly, the
eukaryotic Met-tRNAi, with help from other proteins of the initiation
complex, binds directly to the P site. In both cases, this creates an initiation
complex with a free A site ready to accept the tRNA corresponding to the
first codon after the AUG.

During translation elongation, the mRNA template provides specificity. As
the ribosome moves along the mRNA, each mRNA codon comes into
register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged tRNA
anticodon is ensured. If mRNA were not present in the elongation complex,
the ribosome would bind tRNAs nonspecifically.

Elongation proceeds with charged tRNAs entering the A site and then
shifting to the P site followed by the E site with each single-codon “step” of
the ribosome. Ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that
advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. The energy for each
step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes
GTP. Peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid
attached to the A-site tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid
attached to the P-site tRNA. The formation of each peptide bond is
catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA-based enzyme that is integrated
into the 50S ribosomal subunit. The energy for each peptide bond formation
is derived from GTP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation
factor. The amino acid bound to the P-site tRNA is also linked to the
growing polypeptide chain. As the ribosome steps across the mRNA, the
former P-site tRNA enters the E site, detaches from the amino acid, and is
expelled ([link]). Amazingly, the E. coli translation apparatus takes only
0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid
protein can be translated in just 10 seconds.

   Translation begins when
      an initiator tRNA
    anticodon recognizes a
    codon on mRNA. The
   large ribosomal subunit
     joins the small subunit,
      and a second tRNA is
    recruited. As the mRNA
      moves relative to the
   ribosome, the polypeptide
    chain is formed. Entry of
   a release factor into the A
   site terminates translation
       and the components
            dissociate.


Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. For example,
tetracycline blocks the A site on the bacterial ribosome, and
chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transfer. What specific effect would you
expect each of these antibiotics to have on protein synthesis?
Tetracycline would directly affect:

  a. tRNA binding to the ribosome
  b. ribosome assembly
  c. growth of the protein chain

Chloramphenicol would directly affect

  a. tRNA binding to the ribosome
  b. ribosome assembly
  c. growth of the protein chain




Termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (UAA, UAG, or
UGA) is encountered. Upon aligning with the A site, these nonsense codons
are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct
peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the P-
site amino acid. This reaction forces the P-site amino acid to detach from its
tRNA, and the newly made protein is released. The small and large
ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mRNA and from each other; they
are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex.
After many ribosomes have completed translation, the mRNA is degraded
so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction.

Protein Folding, Modification, and Targeting
During and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically
modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein “folds”
into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular
interactions. A signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a
protein to a specific cellular compartment. These sequences at the amino
end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the protein’s
“train ticket” to its ultimate destination. Other cellular factors recognize
each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to
its correct compartment. For instance, a specific sequence at the amino
terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants).
Once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is
usually clipped off.

Many proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper
molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the
complicated process of folding. Even if a protein is properly specified by its
corresponding mRNA, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if
abnormal temperature or pH conditions prevent it from folding correctly.

Section Summary
The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs,
and various enzymatic factors. The small ribosomal subunit forms on the
mRNA template either at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the
5' cap (eukaryotes). Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA,
specifying methionine. The formation of peptide bonds occurs between
sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the
genetic code. Charged tRNAs enter the ribosomal A site, and their amino
acid bonds with the amino acid at the P site. The entire mRNA is translated
in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a nonsense codon is
encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and
frees the new protein. Folding of the protein occurs during and after
translation.

All life on Earth is related. Evolutionary theory states that humans, beetles,
plants, and bacteria all share a common ancestor, but that millions of years
of evolution have shaped each of these organisms into the forms seen today.
Scientists consider evolution a key concept to understanding life. Natural
selection is one of the most dominant evolutionary forces. Natural selection
acts to promote traits and behaviors that increase an organism’s chances of
survival and reproduction, while eliminating those traits and behaviors that
are to the organism’s detriment. But natural selection can only, as its name
implies, select—it cannot create. The introduction of novel traits and
behaviors falls on the shoulders of another evolutionary force—mutation.
Mutation and other sources of variation among individuals, as well as the
evolutionary forces that act upon them, alter populations and species. This
combination of processes has led to the world of life we see today.
Population Evolution
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Define population genetics and describe how population genetics is
     used in the study of the evolution of populations
     Define the Hardy-Weinberg principle and discuss its importance

The mechanisms of inheritance, or genetics, were not understood at the time
Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were developing their idea of
natural selection. This lack of understanding was a stumbling block to
understanding many aspects of evolution. In fact, the predominant (and
incorrect) genetic theory of the time, blending inheritance, made it difficult
to understand how natural selection might operate. Darwin and Wallace
were unaware of the genetics work by Austrian monk Gregor Mendel,
which was published in 1866, not long after publication of Darwin's book,
On the Origin of Species. Mendel’s work was rediscovered in the early
twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming to an
understanding of the basics of inheritance. Initially, the newly discovered
particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how
gradual evolution could occur. But over the next few decades genetics and
evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesis
—the coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection
and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today.
In sum, the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes, such as
natural selection, can affect a population’s genetic makeup, and, in turn,
how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species. The
theory also connects this change of a population over time, called
microevolution, with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher
taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters, called
macroevolution.



Note:
Everyday Connection
Evolution and Flu Vaccines
Every fall, the media starts reporting on flu vaccinations and potential
outbreaks. Scientists, health experts, and institutions determine
recommendations for different parts of the population, predict optimal
production and inoculation schedules, create vaccines, and set up clinics to
provide inoculations. You may think of the annual flu shot as a lot of media
hype, an important health protection, or just a briefly uncomfortable prick
in your arm. But do you think of it in terms of evolution?
The media hype of annual flu shots is scientifically grounded in our
understanding of evolution. Each year, scientists across the globe strive to
predict the flu strains that they anticipate being most widespread and
harmful in the coming year. This knowledge is based in how flu strains
have evolved over time and over the past few flu seasons. Scientists then
work to create the most effective vaccine to combat those selected strains.
Hundreds of millions of doses are produced in a short period in order to
provide vaccinations to key populations at the optimal time.
Because viruses, like the flu, evolve very quickly (especially in
evolutionary time), this poses quite a challenge. Viruses mutate and
replicate at a fast rate, so the vaccine developed to protect against last
year’s flu strain may not provide the protection needed against the coming
year’s strain. Evolution of these viruses means continued adaptions to
ensure survival, including adaptations to survive previous vaccines.



Population Genetics
Recall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or
variants, that code for different traits associated with that character. For
example, in the ABO blood type system in humans, three alleles determine
the particular blood-type carbohydrate on the surface of red blood cells.
Each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two
alleles for a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the
individuals that make up the population. Mendel followed alleles as they
were inherited from parent to offspring. In the early twentieth century,
biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study
how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and
genotypic frequencies.
The allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific
allele appears within a population. Until now we have discussed evolution
as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind
that phenotypic change is genetic change. In population genetics, the term
evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a
population. Using the ABO blood type system as an example, the frequency
of one of the alleles, IA, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all
the copies of the ABO gene in the population. For example, a study in
Jordan[footnote] found a frequency of IA to be 26.1 percent. The IB and I0
alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively,
and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. A change in this
frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population.
Sahar S. Hanania, Dhia S. Hassawi, and Nidal M. Irshaid, “Allele
Frequency and Molecular Genotypes of ABO Blood Group System in a
Jordanian Population,” Journal of Medical Sciences 7 (2007): 51-58,
doi:10.3923/jms.2007.51.58.

The allele frequency within a given population can change depending on
environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread
than others during the process of natural selection. Natural selection can
alter the population’s genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers
a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more
offspring. Because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial
allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more
offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle.
Over time, the allele will spread throughout the population. Some alleles
will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the
population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly
eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. The gene
pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population.

Sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no
advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. This
phenomenon is called genetic drift. Natural selection and genetic drift
usually occur simultaneously in populations and are not isolated events. It is
hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly
impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each
occurrence. An event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated
part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is
called the founder effect. Natural selection, random drift, and founder
effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population.

Hardy-Weinberg Principle of Equilibrium
In the early twentieth century, English mathematician Godfrey Hardy and
German physician Wilhelm Weinberg stated the principle of equilibrium to
describe the genetic makeup of a population. The theory, which later
became known as the Hardy-Weinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a
population’s allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable— unless
some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the
allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change. The Hardy-Weinberg
principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or
selective pressure for or against genotype, plus an infinite population; while
no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful
model against which to compare real population changes.

Working under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles
as different variables in their mathematical models. The variable p, for
example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say Y for the
trait of yellow in Mendel’s peas, while the variable q represents the
frequency of y alleles that confer the color green. If these are the only two
possible alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. In other
words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that
locus that are found in the population.

But what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of
different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes, known as
the population’s genetic structure, from which scientists can surmise the
distribution of phenotypes. If the phenotype is observed, only the genotype
of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known; the calculations provide
an estimate of the remaining genotypes. Since each individual carries two
alleles per gene, if the allele frequencies (p and q) are known, predicting the
frequencies of these genotypes is a simple mathematical calculation to
determine the probability of getting these genotypes if two alleles are drawn
at random from the gene pool. So in the above scenario, an individual pea
plant could be pp (YY), and thus produce yellow peas; pq (Yy), also
yellow; or qq (yy), and thus producing green peas ([link]). In other words,
the frequency of pp individuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq
individuals is 2pq; and the frequency of qq individuals is q2. And, again, if
p and q are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population,
these genotypes frequencies will sum to one: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.



Note:
Art Connection
     When populations are in the Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium, the allelic frequency is stable from
    generation to generation and the distribution of
      alleles can be determined from the Hardy-
      Weinberg equation. If the allelic frequency
    measured in the field differs from the predicted
   value, scientists can make inferences about what
            evolutionary forces are at play.


In plants, violet flower color (V) is dominant over white (v). If p = 0.8 and
q = 0.2 in a population of 500 plants, how many individuals would you
expect to be homozygous dominant (VV), heterozygous (Vv), and
homozygous recessive (vv)? How many plants would you expect to have
violet flowers, and how many would have white flowers?



In theory, if a population is at equilibrium—that is, there are no
evolutionary forces acting upon it—generation after generation would have
the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all
hold true all of the time. Of course, even Hardy and Weinberg recognized
that no natural population is immune to evolution. Populations in nature are
constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly
migration, and selection. As a result, the only way to determine the exact
distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them. But
the Hardy-Weinberg principle gives scientists a mathematical baseline of a
non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving populations
and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play. If the
frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected from
the Hardy-Weinberg equation, then the population is evolving.

Section Summary
The modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the cohesion of
Darwin’s, Wallace’s, and Mendel’s thoughts on evolution and heredity,
along with the more modern study of population genetics. It describes the
evolution of populations and species, from small-scale changes among
individuals to large-scale changes over paleontological time periods. To
understand how organisms evolve, scientists can track populations’ allele
frequencies over time. If they differ from generation to generation,
scientists can conclude that the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, and is thus evolving.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the different types of variation in a population
     Explain why only heritable variation can be acted upon by natural
     selection
     Describe genetic drift and the bottleneck effect
     Explain how each evolutionary force can influence the allele
     frequencies of a population

Individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express
different alleles of a particular gene, referred to as polymorphisms.
Populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are
called polymorphic. The distribution of phenotypes among individuals,
known as the population variation, is influenced by a number of factors,
including the population’s genetic structure and the environment ([link]).
Understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is
important for determining how a population will evolve in response to
different evolutionary pressures.

  litter of kittens illustrates population
     variation. (credit: Pieter Lanser)




Genetic Variance
Natural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on
heritable traits, namely an organism’s genetic code. Because alleles are
passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or
behaviors may be selected for, while deleterious alleles may be selected
against. Acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. For example, if
an athlete works out in the gym every day, building up muscle strength, the
athlete’s offspring will not necessarily grow up to be a body builder. If there
is a genetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, this may be
passed to a child.



Note:

Before Darwinian evolution became the prevailing theory of the field,
French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck theorized that acquired traits
could, in fact, be inherited; while this hypothesis has largely been
unsupported, scientists have recently begun to realize that Lamarck was
not completely wrong. Visit this site to learn more.



Heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to
genetic differences, or genetic variance, among individuals in a population.
The greater the hereditability of a population’s phenotypic variation, the
more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable
variation.

The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic
variance. When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as
with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a
population’s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic
diversity as they can. This also helps reduce the risks associated with
inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the
undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that
can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. For example, a
disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a population,
but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the
allele. Because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with
unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even
then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from
both parents. While it is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen
frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the
allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at
low levels in the gene pool. However, if a family of carriers begins to
interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of
two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a
phenomenon known as inbreeding depression.

Changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed
light on how it is evolving. In addition to natural selection, there are other
evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation,
nonrandom mating, and environmental variances.

Genetic Drift
The theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some
individuals in a population are more likely to survive longer and have more
offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next
generation. A big, powerful male gorilla, for example, is much more likely
than a smaller, weaker one to become the population’s silverback, the
pack’s leader who mates far more than the other males of the group. The
pack leader will father more offspring, who share half of his genes, and are
likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father. Over time, the
genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population, and the
population will, as a result, grow larger on average. That is, this would
occur if this particular selection pressure, or driving selective force, were
the only one acting on the population. In other examples, better camouflage
or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure.

Another way a population’s allele and genotype frequencies can change is
genetic drift ([link]), which is simply the effect of chance. By chance,
some individuals will have more offspring than others—not due to an
advantage conferred by some genetically-encoded trait, but just because one
male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the receptive
female walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time (when a fox was hunting).



Note:
Art Connection
Genetic drift in a population
can lead to the elimination of
 an allele from a population
 by chance. In this example,
 rabbits with the brown coat
color allele (B) are dominant
 over rabbits with the white
  coat color allele (b). In the
      first generation, the two
      alleles occur with equal
   frequency in the population,
  resulting in p and q values of
         .5. Only half of the
       individuals reproduce,
        resulting in a second
      generation with p and q
         values of .7 and .3,
       respectively. Only two
     individuals in the second
  generation reproduce, and by
   chance these individuals are
    homozygous dominant for
  brown coat color. As a result,
    in the third generation the
      recessive b allele is lost.


Do you think genetic drift would happen more quickly on an island or on
the mainland?



Small populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift. Large
populations, on the other hand, are buffered against the effects of chance. If
one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young
age before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes—
1/10 of the population’s gene pool—will be suddenly lost. In a population
of 100, that’s only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it is much
less impactful on the population’s genetic structure.

in action.



Genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events, such as a natural
disaster that kills—at random—a large portion of the population. Known as
the bottleneck effect, it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly
being wiped out ([link]). In one fell swoop, the genetic structure of the
survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population, which may
be very different from the pre-disaster population.




   A chance event or catastrophe
       can reduce the genetic
   variability within a population.
Another scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence
of genetic drift is if some portion of the population leaves to start a new
population in a new location or if a population gets divided by a physical
barrier of some kind. In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be
representative of the entire population, which results in the founder effect.
The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that
of the new population’s founding fathers and mothers. The founder effect is
believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner
population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that
are common in Afrikaners but rare in most other populations. This is likely
due to the fact that a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding
colonists carried these mutations. As a result, the population expresses
unusually high incidences of Huntington’s disease (HD) and Fanconi
anemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and
congenital abnormalities—even cancer.[footnote]

Scientific Method Connection
Testing the Bottleneck Effect
Question: How do natural disasters affect the genetic structure of a
population?
Background: When much of a population is suddenly wiped out by an
earthquake or hurricane, the individuals that survive the event are usually a
random sampling of the original group. As a result, the genetic makeup of
the population can change dramatically. This phenomenon is known as the
bottleneck effect.
Hypothesis: Repeated natural disasters will yield different population
genetic structures; therefore, each time this experiment is run, the results
will vary.
Test the hypothesis: Count out the original population using different
colored beads. For example, red, blue, and yellow beads might represent
red, blue, and yellow individuals. After recording the number of each
individual in the original population, place them all in a bottle with a
narrow neck that will only allow a few beads out at a time. Then, pour 1/3
of the bottle’s contents into a bowl. This represents the surviving
individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. Count
the number of the different colored beads in the bowl, and record it. Then,
place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the experiment four
more times.
Analyze the data: Compare the five populations that resulted from the
experiment. Do the populations all contain the same number of different
colored beads, or do they vary? Remember, these populations all came
from the same exact parent population.
Form a conclusion: Most likely, the five resulting populations will differ
quite dramatically. This is because natural disasters are not selective—they
kill and spare individuals at random. Now think about how this might
affect a real population. What happens when a hurricane hits the
Mississippi Gulf Coast? How do the seabirds that live on the beach fare?



Gene Flow
Another important evolutionary force is gene flow: the flow of alleles in
and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes
([link]). While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more
flux. Many plants, for example, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or
by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some distance
away. Even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a
pride of lions, can experience its fair share of immigration and emigration
as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with
genetically unrelated females. This variable flow of individuals in and out
of the group not only changes the gene structure of the population, but it
can also introduce new genetic variation to populations in different
geological locations and habitats.




  Gene flow can occur when an individual
  travels from one geographic location to
                 another.




Mutation
Mutations are changes to an organism’s DNA and are an important driver of
diversity in populations. Species evolve because of the accumulation of
mutations that occur over time. The appearance of new mutations is the
most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance.
Some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated
from the population by natural selection. Others are beneficial and will
spread through the population. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or
harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual
maturity and reproduce. Some mutations do not do anything and can linger,
unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. Some can have a dramatic
effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype.

Nonrandom Mating
If individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers, the result can be a
changing population. There are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs.
One reason is simple mate choice; for example, female peahens may prefer
peacocks with bigger, brighter tails. Traits that lead to more matings for an
individual become selected for by natural selection. One common form of
mate choice, called assortative mating, is an individual’s preference to
mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves.

Another cause of nonrandom mating is physical location. This is especially
true in large populations spread over large geographic distances where not
all individuals will have equal access to one another. Some might be miles
apart through woods or over rough terrain, while others might live
immediately nearby.

Environmental Variance
Genes are not the only players involved in determining population
variation. Phenotypes are also influenced by other factors, such as the
environment ([link]). A beachgoer is likely to have darker skin than a city
dweller, for example, due to regular exposure to the sun, an environmental
factor. Some major characteristics, such as sex, are determined by the
environment for some species. For example, some turtles and other reptiles
have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). TSD means that
individuals develop into males if their eggs are incubated within a certain
temperature range, or females at a different temperature range.
    The sex of the American alligator
      (Alligator mississippiensis) is
    determined by the temperature at
   which the eggs are incubated. Eggs
   incubated at 30°C produce females,
   and eggs incubated at 33°C produce
     males. (credit: Steve Hillebrand,
                 USFWS)



Geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the
phenotypic variation between those populations. Such geographical
variation is seen between most populations and can be significant. One
type of geographic variation, called a cline, can be seen as populations of a
given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient. Species of
warm-blooded animals, for example, tend to have larger bodies in the
cooler climates closer to the earth’s poles, allowing them to better conserve
heat. This is considered a latitudinal cline. Alternatively, flowering plants
tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along the
slope of a mountain, known as an altitudinal cline.

If there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely
show gradual differences in phenotype along the cline. Restricted gene
flow, on the other hand, can lead to abrupt differences, even speciation.
Section Summary
Both genetic and environmental factors can cause phenotypic variation in a
population. Different alleles can confer different phenotypes, and different
environments can also cause individuals to look or act differently. Only
those differences encoded in an individual’s genes, however, can be passed
to its offspring and, thus, be a target of natural selection. Natural selection
works by selecting for alleles that confer beneficial traits or behaviors,
while selecting against those for deleterious qualities. Genetic drift stems
from the chance occurrence that some individuals in the germ line have
more offspring than others. When individuals leave or join the population,
allele frequencies can change as a result of gene flow. Mutations to an
individual’s DNA may introduce new variation into a population. Allele
frequencies can also be altered when individuals do not randomly mate with
others in the group.

   organism.




Each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same DNA. A few
exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no DNA in their mature
state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their DNA while
producing antibodies. In general, however, the genes that determine
whether you have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food
are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these
organs function quite differently. If each cell has the same DNA, how is it
that cells or organs are different? Why do cells in the eye differ so
dramatically from cells in the liver?

Whereas each cell shares the same genome and DNA sequence, each cell
does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. Each cell type needs a
different set of proteins to perform its function. Therefore, only a small
subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. For the proteins to be expressed,
the DNA must be transcribed into RNA and the RNA must be translated
into protein. In a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the DNA are
transcribed into RNA or translated into protein because specific cells in our
body have specific functions. Specialized proteins that make up the eye
(iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the
specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves)
are only expressed in the heart. At any given time, only a subset of all of the
genes encoded by our DNA are expressed and translated into proteins. The
expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels
and stages of control. This complexity ensures the proper expression in the
proper cell at the proper time.
Regulation of Gene Expression
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Discuss why every cell does not express all of its genes
     Describe how prokaryotic gene regulation occurs at the transcriptional
     level
     Discuss how eukaryotic gene regulation occurs at the epigenetic,
     transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-
     translational levels

For a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at
the proper time. All cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from
information encoded in their DNA. The process of turning on a gene to
produce RNA and protein is called gene expression. Whether in a simple
unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell
controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must
be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and
protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop
making that protein because it is no longer needed.

The regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. It would
require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every
gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only
when they are required. In addition, only expressing a subset of genes in
each cell saves space because DNA must be unwound from its tightly
coiled structure to transcribe and translate the DNA. Cells would have to be
enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time.

The control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this
process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many
diseases, including cancer.

Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression
To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand
how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners.
Prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus,
and their DNA therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm. To synthesize a
protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost
simultaneously. When the resulting protein is no longer needed,
transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type of
protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is
the regulation of DNA transcription. All of the subsequent steps occur
automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs.
Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at
the transcriptional level.

Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their
complexity. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s
nucleus and there it is transcribed into RNA. The newly synthesized RNA is
then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes
translate the RNA into protein. The processes of transcription and
translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription
occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the
nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all
stages of the process ([link]). Regulation may occur when the DNA is
uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors
(epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level),
when the RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is
transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into
protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made (post-
translational level).
   Prokaryotic transcription and translation occur simultaneously
    in the cytoplasm, and regulation occurs at the transcriptional
        level. Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated during
     transcription and RNA processing, which take place in the
    nucleus, and during protein translation, which takes place in
     the cytoplasm. Further regulation may occur through post-
                translational modifications of proteins.



The differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes
and eukaryotes are summarized in [link]. The regulation of gene expression
is discussed in detail in subsequent modules.

Note:
Evolution Connection
Evolution of Gene Regulation
Prokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the
amount of transcription. As eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the
control of gene expression increased. For example, with the evolution of
eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular
components and cellular processes. A nuclear region that contains the
DNA was formed. Transcription and translation were physically separated
into two different cellular compartments. It therefore became possible to
control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also
by controlling the RNA levels and protein translation present outside the
nucleus.
Some cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend
itself. Cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the
cell from viral or parasitic infections. If the cell could quickly shut off gene
expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an
infection when other organisms could not. Therefore, the organism evolved
a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new
development to offspring.



Section Summary
While all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA, not all
cells within that organism express the same proteins. Prokaryotic organisms
express the entire DNA they encode in every cell, but not necessarily all at
the same time. Proteins are expressed only when they are needed.
Eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the DNA that is encoded in any
given cell. In each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by
controlling gene expression. To express a protein, the DNA is first
transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. In prokaryotic
cells, these processes occur almost simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells,
transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation that
occurs in the cytoplasm. Gene expression in prokaryotes is mostly regulated
at the transcriptional level (some epigenetic and post-translational
regulation is also present), whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene expression is
regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional,
translational, and post-translational levels.

Free Response
Exercise:
  Problem:

  Name two differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and
  how these differences benefit multicellular organisms.

  Solution:

  Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, whereas prokaryotic cells do not. In
  eukaryotic cells, DNA is confined within the nuclear region. Because
  of this, transcription and translation are physically separated. This
  creates a more complex mechanism for the control of gene expression
  that benefits multicellular organisms because it compartmentalizes
  gene regulation.

  Gene expression occurs at many stages in eukaryotic cells, whereas in
  prokaryotic cells, control of gene expression only occurs at the
  transcriptional level. This allows for greater control of gene expression
  in eukaryotes and more complex systems to be developed. Because of
  this, different cell types can arise in an individual organism.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  Describe how controlling gene expression will alter the overall protein
  levels in the cell.

  Solution:

  The cell controls which proteins are expressed and to what level each
  protein is expressed in the cell. Prokaryotic cells alter the transcription
  rate to turn genes on or off. This method will increase or decrease
  protein levels in response to what is needed by the cell. Eukaryotic
  cells change the accessibility (epigenetic), transcription, or translation
  of a gene. This will alter the amount of RNA and the lifespan of the
  RNA to alter the amount of protein that exists. Eukaryotic cells also
  control protein translation to increase or decrease the overall levels.
  Eukaryotic organisms are much more complex and can manipulate
  protein levels by changing many stages in the process.

Prokaryotic Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the steps involved in prokaryotic gene regulation
     Explain the roles of activators, inducers, and repressors in gene
     regulation

The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome
supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are
needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical
pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons. For example, all of
the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each
other in the lactose (or lac) operon.

In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can
affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers.
Repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to
an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the
transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Finally, inducers
are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending
on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.

The trp Operon: A Repressor Operon
Bacteria such as E. coli need amino acids to survive. Tryptophan is one
such amino acid that E. coli can ingest from the environment. E. coli can
also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes.
These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan
(trp) operon ([link]). If tryptophan is present in the environment, then E.
coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation
of the genes in the trp operon is switched off. However, when tryptophan
availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on,
transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is
synthesized.
      The five genes that are needed to synthesize
  tryptophan in E. coli are located next to each other
    in the trp operon. When tryptophan is plentiful,
      two tryptophan molecules bind the repressor
    protein at the operator sequence. This physically
  blocks the RNA polymerase from transcribing the
   tryptophan genes. When tryptophan is absent, the
  repressor protein does not bind to the operator and
                 the genes are transcribed.



A DNA sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region.
The five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are
arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. Just before the
coding region is the transcriptional start site. This is the region of DNA to
which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter
sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a
sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or
repressors) can bind and regulate transcription.

A DNA sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the
promoter region and the first trp coding gene. This operator contains the
DNA code to which the repressor protein can bind. When tryptophan is
present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor,
which changes shape to bind to the trp operator. Binding of the tryptophan–
repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase
from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes.

When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not
bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is
synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to
keep the genes turned off, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the
proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative
regulators.

Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): An Activator Regulator
Just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there
are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive
regulator to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is
scarce, E. coli bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this,
new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. When
glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell.
The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and
energy metabolism in E. coli. When glucose levels decline in the cell,
accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator
protein (CAP), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control
the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the
complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use
the alternate sugar sources ([link]). In these operons, a CAP binding site is
located upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site in the promoter. This
increases the binding ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and
the transcription of the genes.




    When glucose levels fall, E. coli may use other
  sugars for fuel but must transcribe new genes to do
    so. As glucose supplies become limited, cAMP
     levels increase. This cAMP binds to the CAP
      protein, a positive regulator that binds to an
   operator region upstream of the genes required to
                 use other sugar sources.




The lac Operon: An Inducer Operon
The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through
inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress
transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell.
The lac operon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, E.
coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose
concentrations are low. To do so, the cAMP–CAP protein complex serves
as a positive regulator to induce transcription. One such sugar source is
lactose. The lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process
the lactose from the local environment. CAP binds to the operator sequence
upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon.
However, for the lac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met.
First, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. Second, lactose
must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the
lac operon be transcribed ([link]). This makes sense for the cell, because it
would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if
glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available.



Note:
Art Connection
  Transcription of the lac operon
  is carefully regulated so that its
   expression only occurs when
  glucose is limited and lactose is
        present to serve as an
       alternative fuel source.


In E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off. Why
do you think this is the case?
If glucose is absent, then CAP can bind to the operator sequence to activate
transcription. If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to
prevent transcription. If either of these requirements is met, then
transcription remains off. Only when both conditions are satisfied is the lac
operon transcribed ([link]).

Section Summary
The regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the
transcriptional level. There are three ways to control the transcription of an
operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control.
Repressive control, typified by the trp operon, uses proteins bound to the
operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of RNA polymerase
and the activation of transcription. Therefore, if tryptophan is not needed,
the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off.
Activator control, typified by the action of CAP, increases the binding
ability of RNA polymerase to the promoter when CAP is bound. In this
case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of cAMP to CAP. CAP then
binds the promoter, which allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter
better. In the last example—the lac operon—two conditions must be met to
initiate transcription. Glucose must not be present, and lactose must be
available for the lac operon to be transcribed. If glucose is absent, CAP
binds to the operator. If lactose is present, the repressor protein does not
bind to its operator. Only when both conditions are met will RNA
polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.

  Problem:

  [link] In E. coli, the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is
  off. Why do you think that this is the case?

  Solution:

  [link] Tryptophan is an amino acid essential for making proteins, so
  the cell always needs to have some on hand. However, if plenty of
  tryptophan is present, it is wasteful to make more, and the expression
  of the trp receptor is repressed. Lactose, a sugar found in milk, is not
  always available. It makes no sense to make the enzymes necessary to
  digest an energy source that is not available, so the lac operon is only
  turned on when lactose is present.

  external stimulation such as excess lactose in the environment.

  Solution:

  Environmental stimuli can increase or induce transcription in

Exercise:
  Problem:

  What is the difference between a repressible and an inducible operon?

  Solution:

  A repressible operon uses a protein bound to the promoter region of a
  gene to keep the gene repressed or silent. This repressor must be
  actively removed in order to transcribe the gene. An inducible operon
  is either activated or repressed depending on the needs of the cell and
  what is available in the local environment.

Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain the process of epigenetic regulation
     Describe how access to DNA is controlled by histone modification

Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene
expression because the processes of transcription and translation are
physically separated. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate
gene expression at many different levels. Eukaryotic gene expression begins
with control of access to the DNA. This form of regulation, called
epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated.

Epigenetic Control: Regulating Access to Genes within the
Chromosome
The human genome encodes over 20,000 genes; each of the 23 pairs of
human chromosomes encodes thousands of genes. The DNA in the nucleus
is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will
fit into the nucleus. It is also organized so that specific segments can be
accessed as needed by a specific cell type.

The first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of DNA strands
around histone proteins. Histones package and order DNA into structural
units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of
proteins to the DNA regions ([link]a). Under the electron microscope, this
winding of DNA around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like
small beads on a string ([link]b). These beads (histone proteins) can move
along the string (DNA) and change the structure of the molecule.
          DNA is folded around histone proteins to create (a)
   nucleosome complexes. These nucleosomes control the access
    of proteins to the underlying DNA. When viewed through an
   electron microscope (b), the nucleosomes look like beads on a
     string. (credit “micrograph”: modification of work by Chris
                              Woodcock)



If DNA encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into RNA, the
nucleosomes surrounding that region of DNA can slide down the DNA to
open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional
machinery (RNA polymerase) to initiate transcription ([link]). Nucleosomes
can move to open the chromosome structure to expose a segment of DNA,
but do so in a very controlled manner.



Note:
Art Connection
        Nucleosomes can slide along DNA. When
      nucleosomes are spaced closely together (top),
        transcription factors cannot bind and gene
     expression is turned off. When the nucleosomes
   are spaced far apart (bottom), the DNA is exposed.
       Transcription factors can bind, allowing gene
    expression to occur. Modifications to the histones
           and DNA affect nucleosome spacing.


In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated during embryonic
development because of epigenetic changes to the chromatin. What impact
do you think these changes would have on nucleosome packing?



How the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the
histone proteins and on the DNA. These signals are tags added to histone
proteins and DNA that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be
open or closed ([link] depicts modifications to histone proteins and DNA).
These tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as needed.
They are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that
are attached to specific amino acids in the protein or to the nucleotides of
the DNA. The tags do not alter the DNA base sequence, but they do alter
how tightly wound the DNA is around the histone proteins. DNA is a
negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone
will change how tightly wound the DNA molecule will be. When
unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding
chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive.

The DNA molecule itself can also be modified. This occurs within very
specific regions called CpG islands. These are stretches with a high
frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide DNA pairs (CG) found in
the promoter regions of genes. When this configuration exists, the cytosine
member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). This
modification changes how the DNA interacts with proteins, including the
histone proteins that control access to the region. Highly methylated
(hypermethylated) DNA regions with deacetylated histones are tightly
coiled and transcriptionally inactive.




   Histone proteins and DNA nucleotides can be modified
  chemically. Modifications affect nucleosome spacing and
   gene expression. (credit: modification of work by NIH)



This type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic
means “around genetics.” The changes that occur to the histone proteins
and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent.
Instead, these changes are temporary (although they often persist through
multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open
or closed) as needed. A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the
location and modifications to the histone proteins and DNA. If a gene is to
be transcribed, the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the
chromosomal region encoding that gene. This opens the chromosomal
region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins, called
transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream
of the gene, and initiate transcription. If a gene is to remain turned off, or
silenced, the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that
signal a closed chromosomal configuration. In this closed configuration, the
RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA
and transcription cannot occur ([link]).

Section Summary
In eukaryotic cells, the first stage of gene expression control occurs at the
epigenetic level. Epigenetic mechanisms control access to the chromosomal
region to allow genes to be turned on or off. These mechanisms control how
DNA is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the DNA is
wound around histone proteins. The addition or removal of chemical
modifications (or flags) to histone proteins or DNA signals to the cell to
open or close a chromosomal region. Therefore, eukaryotic cells can control
whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to transcription
factors and the binding of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.

Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Discuss the role of transcription factors in gene regulation
     Explain how enhancers and repressors regulate gene expression

Like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the
actions of an RNA polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to
initiate transcription. However, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic
RNA polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to
facilitate transcription initiation. Transcription factors are proteins that bind
to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the
transcription of the target gene. RNA polymerase by itself cannot initiate
transcription in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors must bind to the
promoter region first and recruit RNA polymerase to the site for
transcription to be established.

template.

The Promoter and the Transcription Machinery
Genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. The
promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence. This
region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long
(hundreds of nucleotides long). The longer the promoter, the more available
space for proteins to bind. This also adds more control to the transcription
process. The length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ
dramatically between genes. Consequently, the level of control of gene
expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. The purpose of
the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of
transcription.

Within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site,
resides the TATA box. This box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine
dinucleotides (literally, TATA repeats). RNA polymerase binds to the
transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur. To initiate
transcription, a transcription factor (TFIID) is the first to bind to the TATA
box. Binding of TFIID recruits other transcription factors, including TFIIB,
TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH to the TATA box. Once this complex is assembled,
RNA polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. When bound along
with the transcription factors, RNA polymerase is phosphorylated. This
releases part of the protein from the DNA to activate the transcription
initiation complex and places RNA polymerase in the correct orientation to
begin transcription; DNA-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can
be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and
mediator proteins ([link]).
    An enhancer is a DNA sequence
   that promotes transcription. Each
  enhancer is made up of short DNA
     sequences called distal control
   elements. Activators bound to the
     distal control elements interact
       with mediator proteins and
  transcription factors. Two different
        genes may have the same
      promoter but different distal
       control elements, enabling
      differential gene expression.



In addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors
can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription. These transcription
factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. They are not general
transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited
to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene. There are
hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a
particular DNA sequence motif. When transcription factors bind to the
promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting
element, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. The
region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the
transcription factor binding site. Transcription factors respond to
environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and
initiate transcription of the gene that is needed.

Enhancers and Transcription
In some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance
transcription. These regions, called enhancers, are not necessarily close to
the genes they enhance. They can be located upstream of a gene, within the
coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of
nucleotides away.

Enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors.
When a DNA-bending protein binds, the shape of the DNA changes
([link]). This shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound
to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region
and the RNA polymerase. Whereas DNA is generally depicted as a straight
line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. Therefore,
a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and
interact with a specific promoter.

Turning Genes Off: Transcriptional Repressors
Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent
transcription. Transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer
regions and block transcription. Like the transcriptional activators,
repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating
transcription factors.

Section Summary
To start transcription, general transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIH,
and others, must first bind to the TATA box and recruit RNA polymerase to
that location. The binding of additional regulatory transcription factors to
cis-acting elements will either increase or prevent transcription. In addition
to promoter sequences, enhancer regions help augment transcription.
Enhancers can be upstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other
chromosomes. Transcription factors bind to enhancer regions to increase or
prevent transcription.

  mutation could either decrease the ability of the transcription factor to
  bind, thereby decreasing transcription, or it can increase the ability of
  the transcription factor to bind, thus increasing transcription.

Eukaryotic Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Understand RNA splicing and explain its role in regulating gene
     expression
     Describe the importance of RNA stability in gene regulation

RNA is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before
translation can begin. This processing after an RNA molecule has been
transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-
transcriptional modification. As with the epigenetic and transcriptional
stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to
control gene expression in the cell. If the RNA is not processed, shuttled, or
translated, then no protein will be synthesized.

RNA splicing, the first stage of post-transcriptional control
In eukaryotic cells, the RNA transcript often contains regions, called
introns, that are removed prior to translation. The regions of RNA that code
for protein are called exons ([link]). After an RNA molecule has been
transcribed, but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the
RNA is processed and the introns are removed by splicing.




    Pre-mRNA can be alternatively spliced to
           create different proteins.
Note:
Evolution Connection
Alternative RNA Splicing
In the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative RNA
splicing. Alternative RNA splicing is a mechanism that allows different
protein products to be produced from one gene when different
combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the
transcript ([link]). This alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more
often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the
frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way
to control the production of different protein products in different cells or
at different stages of development. Alternative splicing is now understood
to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to
one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple
proteins through alternative splicing.




    There are five basic modes of alternative
                    splicing.
How could alternative splicing evolve? Introns have a beginning and
ending recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the failure of the
splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the
end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon.
In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but
mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such “mistakes” would more
than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of many
genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence.
However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the
loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the
new variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important
role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by providing genes
that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein.

Control of RNA Stability
Before the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective "caps" that
prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. The 5' cap,
which is placed on the 5' end of the mRNA, is usually composed of a
methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (GTP). The poly-A tail, which
is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine
nucleotides. Once the RNA is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of
time that the RNA resides there can be controlled. Each RNA molecule has
a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. This rate of decay can
influence how much protein is in the cell. If the decay rate is increased, the
RNA will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for
translation to occur. Conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the RNA
molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be
translated. This rate of decay is referred to as the RNA stability. If the RNA
is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm.

Binding of proteins to the RNA can influence its stability. Proteins, called
RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs, can bind to the regions of the RNA just
upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. These regions in the
RNA that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated
regions, or UTRs. They are not introns (those have been removed in the
nucleus). Rather, these are regions that regulate mRNA localization,
stability, and protein translation. The region just before the protein-coding
region is called the 5' UTR, whereas the region after the coding region is
called the 3' UTR ([link]). The binding of RBPs to these regions can
increase or decrease the stability of an RNA molecule, depending on the
specific RBP that binds.




  The protein-coding region of mRNA is flanked by
      5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The
   presence of RNA-binding proteins at the 5' or 3'
  UTR influences the stability of the RNA molecule.
RNA Stability and microRNAs

In addition to RBPs that bind to and control (increase or decrease) RNA
stability, other elements called microRNAs can bind to the RNA molecule.
These microRNAs, or miRNAs, are short RNA molecules that are only 21–
24 nucleotides in length. The miRNAs are made in the nucleus as longer
pre-miRNAs. These pre-miRNAs are chopped into mature miRNAs by a
protein called dicer. Like transcription factors and RBPs, mature miRNAs
recognize a specific sequence and bind to the RNA; however, miRNAs also
associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC). RISC binds along with the miRNA to degrade
the target mRNA. Together, miRNAs and the RISC complex rapidly destroy
the RNA molecule.

Section Summary
Post-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription,
including RNA splicing, nuclear shuttling, and RNA stability. Once RNA is
transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature RNA that is ready to be
translated. This involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein.
Spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron border to
remove the introns and ligate the exons together. Once this occurs, the RNA
is mature and can be translated. RNA is created and spliced in the nucleus,
but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated. RNA is
transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. Once the
RNA is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it resides there before being
degraded, called RNA stability, can also be altered to control the overall
amount of protein that is synthesized. The RNA stability can be increased,
leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased, leading to
shortened time and less protein synthesis. RNA stability is controlled by
RNA-binding proteins (RPBs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). These RPBs and
miRNAs bind to the 5' UTR or the 3' UTR of the RNA to increase or
decrease RNA stability. Depending on the RBP, the stability can be
increased or decreased significantly; however, miRNAs always decrease
stability and promote decay.

  Describe how RBPs can prevent miRNAs from degrading an RNA
  molecule.

  Solution:

  RNA binding proteins (RBP) bind to the RNA and can either increase
  or decrease the stability of the RNA. If they increase the stability of
  the RNA molecule, the RNA will remain intact in the cell for a longer
  period of time than normal. Since both RBPs and miRNAs bind to the
  RNA molecule, RBP can potentially bind first to the RNA and prevent
  the binding of the miRNA that will degrade it.

Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Understand the process of translation and discuss its key factors
     Describe how the initiation complex controls translation
     Explain the different ways in which the post-translational control of
     gene expression takes place

After the RNA has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into
protein. Control of this process is largely dependent on the RNA molecule.
As previously discussed, the stability of the RNA will have a large impact
on its translation into a protein. As the stability changes, the amount of time
that it is available for translation also changes.

The Initiation Complex and Translation Rate
Like transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate
the process. In translation, the complex that assembles to start the process is
referred to as the initiation complex. The first protein to bind to the RNA
to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2). The eIF-
2 protein is active when it binds to the high-energy molecule guanosine
triphosphate (GTP). GTP provides the energy to start the reaction by
giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The
eIF-2 protein bound to GTP binds to the small 40S ribosomal subunit.
When bound, the methionine initiator tRNA associates with the eIF-2/40S
ribosome complex, bringing along with it the mRNA to be translated. At
this point, when the initiator complex is assembled, the GTP is converted
into GDP and energy is released. The phosphate and the eIF-2 protein are
released from the complex and the large 60S ribosomal subunit binds to
translate the RNA. The binding of eIF-2 to the RNA is controlled by
phosphorylation. If eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a conformational
change and cannot bind to GTP. Therefore, the initiation complex cannot
form properly and translation is impeded ([link]). When eIF-2 remains
unphosphorylated, it binds the RNA and actively translates the protein.
Note:

   Gene expression can be controlled
   by factors that bind the translation
           initiation complex.


An increase in phosphorylation levels of eIF-2 has been observed in
patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s,
and Huntington’s. What impact do you think this might have on protein
synthesis?



Chemical Modifications, Protein Activity, and Longevity
Proteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including
methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. The addition or removal of
these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they
exist in the cell. Sometimes these modifications can regulate where a
protein is found in the cell—for example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or
attached to the plasma membrane.

Chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress,
the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. These changes can
alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mRNA stability, or translation—
all resulting in changes in expression of various genes. This is an efficient
way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response
to the environment. Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene
regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that
is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation
(by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear
shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can
alter RNA stability (by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its
stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-
translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical
modifications).

The addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for
degradation. Ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is
complete. These proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that
functions to remove proteins, to be degraded ([link]). One way to control
gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein.




      Proteins with ubiquitin tags are
     marked for degradation within the
               proteasome.




Section Summary
Changing the status of the RNA or the protein itself can affect the amount
of protein, the function of the protein, or how long it is found in the cell. To
translate the protein, a protein initiator complex must assemble on the RNA.
Modifications (such as phosphorylation) of proteins in this complex can
prevent proper translation from occurring. Once a protein has been
synthesized, it can be modified (phosphorylated, acetylated, methylated, or
ubiquitinated). These post-translational modifications can greatly impact
the stability, degradation, or function of the protein.

Cancer and Gene Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe how changes to gene expression can cause cancer
     Explain how changes to gene expression at different levels can disrupt
     the cell cycle
     Discuss how understanding regulation of gene expression can lead to
     better drug design

Cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases. In
cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells don’t stop
growing as they normally would. Mutations can also alter the growth rate or
the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. One example of a gene
modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of
cyclin B, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell
cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein.

For cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass
through checkpoints. This ensures that the cell has properly completed the
step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. Many
proteins, including cyclin B, control these checkpoints. The
phosphorylation of cyclin B, a post-translational event, alters its function.
As a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if
mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. This post-
translational change of cyclin B prevents it from controlling the cell cycle
and contributes to the development of cancer.

Cancer: Disease of Altered Gene Expression
Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. There are
many proteins that are turned on or off (gene activation or gene silencing)
that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. A gene that is not
normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high
levels. This can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation
(epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-
translation).
Changes in epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA stability, protein
translation, and post-translational control can be detected in cancer. While
these changes don’t occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of
these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in
different individuals. Therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic
modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors
by phosphorylation, increased RNA stability, increased translational
control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in
various cancer cells. Scientists are working to understand the common
changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification
might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell.



Tumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes, and Cancer

In normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell
growth. These are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells
to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. There are many tumor suppressor
genes in cells. The most studied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is
mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types. The p53 protein itself
functions as a transcription factor. It can bind to sites in the promoters of
genes to initiate transcription. Therefore, the mutation of p53 in cancer will
dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes.



Note:
Link to Learning




Watch this animation to learn more about the use of p53 in fighting cancer.
Proto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. When mutated, proto-
oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer. Overexpression of the
oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. This is because oncogenes
can alter transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another
gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. An example of an
oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. Myc is a transcription
factor that is aberrantly activated in Burkett’s Lymphoma, a cancer of the
lymph system. Overexpression of myc transforms normal B cells into
cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. High B-cell numbers
can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. Patients
with Burkett’s lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth
that interfere with the ability to eat.

Cancer and Epigenetic Alterations
Silencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in
cancer cells. There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and
DNA that are associated with silenced genes. In cancer cells, the DNA in
the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA
residues in CpG islands. Histone proteins that surround that region lack the
acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in
normal cells. This combination of DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is
commonly found in cancer. When these modifications occur, the gene
present in that chromosomal region is silenced. Increasingly, scientists
understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer. Because these
changes are temporary and can be reversed—for example, by preventing the
action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by
DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in
DNA—it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take
advantage of the reversible nature of these processes. Indeed, many
researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a
cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns.

Genes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from
allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be regulated by
epigenetic mechanisms. As our knowledge of how genes are controlled
deepens, new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge.

Cancer and Transcriptional Control
Alterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional
control of gene expression. Mutations that activate transcription factors,
such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a
transcription factor to its binding site in a promoter. This could lead to
increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell
growth. Alternatively, a mutation in the DNA of a promoter or enhancer
region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor. This could
also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is
seen in cancer cells.

Researchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional
activation of gene expression in cancer. Identifying how a transcription
factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has
led to new drugs and new ways to treat cancer. In breast cancer, for
example, many proteins are overexpressed. This can lead to increased
phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. One
such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) in a subset of breast cancers. The EGFR pathway activates many
protein kinases that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control
genes involved in cell growth. New drugs that prevent the activation of
EGFR have been developed and are used to treat these cancers.

Cancer and Post-transcriptional Control
Changes in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in
cancer. Recently, several groups of researchers have shown that specific
cancers have altered expression of miRNAs. Because miRNAs bind to the
3' UTR of RNA molecules to degrade them, overexpression of these
miRNAs could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. Too many
miRNAs could dramatically decrease the RNA population leading to a
decrease in protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated a change
in the miRNA population in specific cancer types. It appears that the subset
of miRNAs expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the
subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. This
suggests that alterations in miRNA activity can contribute to the growth of
breast cancer cells. These types of studies also suggest that if some
miRNAs are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be
potential drug targets. It would, therefore, be conceivable that new drugs
that turn off miRNA expression in cancer could be an effective method to
treat cancer.

Cancer and Translational/Post-translational Control
There are many examples of how translational or post-translational
modifications of proteins arise in cancer. Modifications are found in cancer
cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein
phosphorylation to alternative splice variants of a protein. An example of
how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have
dramatically different outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. The c-Flip
protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell death pathway, comes in
two forms: long (c-FLIPL) and short (c-FLIPS). Both forms appear to be
involved in initiating controlled cell death mechanisms in normal cells.
However, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in
increased cell growth instead of cell death. Clearly, the expression of the
wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the
development of cancer.

New Drugs to Combat Cancer: Targeted Therapies
Scientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression
in disease states, including cancer, to develop new ways to treat and prevent
disease development. Many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of
the gene expression patterns within individual tumors. This idea, that
therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the
field of personalized medicine. With an increased understanding of gene
regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically
target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. Some new medicines,
called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific
protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat
disease. One such example is the use of anti-EGF receptor medications to
treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the
EGF protein. Undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as
scientists learn more about how gene expression changes can cause cancer.

Career Connection
Clinical Trial Coordinator
A clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the
clinical trial. This job includes coordinating patient schedules and
appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track
patients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper
documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the
nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. A
clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing
degree, or other certification. People who have worked in science labs or in
clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator.
These jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctor’s
offices also conduct clinical trials and may hire a coordinator.



Section Summary
Cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. Changes at
every level of eukaryotic gene expression can be detected in some form of
cancer at some point in time. In order to understand how changes to gene
expression can cause cancer, it is critical to understand how each stage of
gene regulation works in normal cells. By understanding the mechanisms of
control in normal, non-diseased cells, it will be easier for scientists to
understand what goes wrong in disease states including complex ones like
cancer.

A human, as well as every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a
fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote. Trillions of cell divisions subsequently
occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. In
other words, that original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the
body. Once a being is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to
repair or regenerate tissues. For example, new blood and skin cells are
constantly being produced. All multicellular organisms use cell division for
growth and the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. Cell division is
tightly regulated, and the occasional failure of regulation can have life-
threatening consequences. Single-celled organisms use cell division as their
method of reproduction.
Cell Division
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes
     Distinguish between chromosomes, genes, and traits
     Describe the mechanisms of chromosome compaction

The continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the
reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle. The cell cycle is an orderly
sequence of events that describes the stages of a cell’s life from the division
of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells. The
mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated.

Genomic DNA
Before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate, a deeper
understanding of the structure and function of a cell’s genetic information is
necessary. A cell’s DNA, packaged as a double-stranded DNA molecule, is
called its genome. In prokaryotes, the genome is composed of a single,
double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a loop or circle ([link]). The
region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid. Some
prokaryotes also have smaller loops of DNA called plasmids that are not
essential for normal growth. Bacteria can exchange these plasmids with
other bacteria, sometimes receiving beneficial new genes that the recipient
can add to their chromosomal DNA. Antibiotic resistance is one trait that
often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange.
   Prokaryotes, including bacteria
      and archaea, have a single,
  circular chromosome located in a
  central region called the nucleoid.



In eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear DNA
molecules ([link]). Each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number
of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells. Human body cells have 46
chromosomes, while human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23
chromosomes each. A typical body cell, or somatic cell, contains two
matched sets of chromosomes, a configuration known as diploid. The letter
n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes; therefore, a diploid
organism is designated 2n. Human cells that contain one set of
chromosomes are called gametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm,
and are designated 1n, or haploid.
   There are 23 pairs of homologous
   chromosomes in a female human
      somatic cell. The condensed
   chromosomes are viewed within
  the nucleus (top), removed from a
  cell in mitosis and spread out on a
      slide (right), and artificially
  arranged according to length (left);
  an arrangement like this is called a
      karyotype. In this image, the
    chromosomes were exposed to
          fluorescent stains for
     differentiation of the different
      chromosomes. A method of
     staining called “chromosome
     painting” employs fluorescent
   dyes that highlight chromosomes
       in different colors. (credit:
       National Human Genome
              Project/NIH)



Matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called
homologous (“same knowledge”) chromosomes. Homologous
chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments
called genes in exactly the same location, or locus. Genes, the functional
units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for
specific proteins. Traits are the variations of those characteristics. For
example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are blonde, brown, or
black.

Each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a
different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are not identical. The
variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination
of the genes inherited from both parents. Even a slightly altered sequence of
nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. For example,
there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that
code for blood type: sequence A, sequence B, and sequence O. Because all
diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines
blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of
the marker gene are inherited. It is possible to have two copies of the same
gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for
example, AA, BB, or OO), or two different sequences, such as AB.

Minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness,
contribute to the natural variation found within a species. However, if the
entire DNA sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is
compared, the difference is less than one percent. The sex chromosomes, X
and Y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome
uniformity: Other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to
accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the X and Y chromosomes
are different.

Eukaryotic Chromosomal Structure and Compaction
If the DNA from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out
end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its
diameter would be only 2 nm. Considering that the size of a typical human
cell is about 10 µm (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), DNA must
be tightly packaged to fit in the cell’s nucleus. At the same time, it must
also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. During some stages
of the cell cycle, the long strands of DNA are condensed into compact
chromosomes. There are a number of ways that chromosomes are
compacted.

In the first level of compaction, short stretches of the DNA double helix
wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the
entire length of the chromosome ([link]). The DNA-histone complex is
called chromatin. The beadlike, histone DNA complex is called a
nucleosome, and DNA connecting the nucleosomes is called linker DNA.
A DNA molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double
helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in
contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a DNA double helix. The next level of
compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker DNA between them
are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. This coiling further shortens the
chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended
form. In the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to
pack the chromatin. These fibrous proteins also ensure that each
chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus
that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image
in [link]).
    Double-stranded DNA wraps
   around histone proteins to form
      nucleosomes that have the
  appearance of “beads on a string.”
  The nucleosomes are coiled into a
   30-nm chromatin fiber. When a
     cell undergoes mitosis, the
    chromosomes condense even
               further.



DNA replicates in the S phase of interphase. After replication, the
chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids. When fully
compact, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each
other by cohesin proteins. The connection between the sister chromatids is
closest in a region called the centromere. The conjoined sister chromatids,
with a diameter of about 1 µm, are visible under a light microscope. The
centromeric region is highly condensed and thus will appear as a constricted
area.

Section Summary
Prokaryotes have a single circular chromosome composed of double-
stranded DNA, whereas eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes
composed of chromatin surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The 46
chromosomes of human somatic cells are composed of 22 pairs of
autosomes (matched pairs) and a pair of sex chromosomes, which may or
may not be matched. This is the 2n or diploid state. Human gametes have
23 chromosomes or one complete set of chromosomes; a set of
chromosomes is complete with either one of the sex chromosomes. This is
the n or haploid state. Genes are segments of DNA that code for a specific
protein. An organism’s traits are determined by the genes inherited from
each parent. Duplicated chromosomes are composed of two sister
chromatids. Chromosomes are compacted using a variety of mechanisms
during certain stages of the cell cycle. Several classes of protein are
involved in the organization and packing of the chromosomal DNA into a
highly condensed structure. The condensing complex compacts
chromosomes, and the resulting condensed structure is necessary for
chromosomal segregation during mitosis.

The Cell Cycle
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe the three stages of interphase
     Discuss the behavior of chromosomes during karyokinesis
     Explain how the cytoplasmic content is divided during cytokinesis
     Define the quiescent G0 phase

The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell
division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell
division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated
stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produces two identical
(clone) cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the
mitotic phase ([link]). During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is
replicated. During the mitotic phase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic
contents are separated, and the cell divides.




    The cell cycle consists of interphase and the mitotic phase.
    During interphase, the cell grows and the nuclear DNA is
  duplicated. Interphase is followed by the mitotic phase. During
   the mitotic phase, the duplicated chromosomes are segregated
   and distributed into daughter nuclei. The cytoplasm is usually
          divided as well, resulting in two daughter cells.




Interphase
During interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also
preparing for cell division. In order for a cell to move from interphase into
the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The
three stages of interphase are called G1, S, and G2.



G1 Phase (First Gap)

The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase (first gap) because, from
a microscopic aspect, little change is visible. However, during the G1 stage,
the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the
building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins as well as
accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating
each chromosome in the nucleus.



S Phase (Synthesis of DNA)

Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed
chromatin configuration. In the S phase, DNA replication can proceed
through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of
DNA molecules—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached to the
centromeric region. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The
two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that
orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. At the center of
each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair
of rod-like objects, the centrioles, which are at right angles to each other.
Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the
centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.



G2 Phase (Second Gap)

In the G2 phase, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes
proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are
duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the
mitotic phase. There may be additional cell growth during G2. The final
preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able
to enter the first stage of mitosis.

The Mitotic Phase
The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated
chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into two new, identical
daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis,
or nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called
cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into
the two daughter cells.

Karyokinesis (Mitosis)

Karyokinesis, also known as mitosis, is divided into a series of phases—
prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—that result in
the division of the cell nucleus ([link]). Karyokinesis is also called mitosis.



Note:
Art Connection




  Karyokinesis (or mitosis) is divided into five stages—prophase,
      prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The
   pictures at the bottom were taken by fluorescence microscopy
    (hence, the black background) of cells artificially stained by
         fluorescent dyes: blue fluorescence indicates DNA
   (chromosomes) and green fluorescence indicates microtubules
  (spindle apparatus). (credit “mitosis drawings”: modification of

   micrograph”: Wadsworth Center/New York State Department
           of Health; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)


Which of the following is the correct order of events in mitosis?

  a. Sister chromatids line up at the metaphase plate. The kinetochore
     becomes attached to the mitotic spindle. The nucleus reforms and the
     cell divides. Cohesin proteins break down and the sister chromatids
     separate.
  b. The kinetochore becomes attached to the mitotic spindle. Cohesin
     proteins break down and the sister chromatids separate. Sister
     chromatids line up at the metaphase plate. The nucleus reforms and
     the cell divides.
  c. The kinetochore becomes attached to the cohesin proteins. Sister
     chromatids line up at the metaphase plate. The kinetochore breaks
     down and the sister chromatids separate. The nucleus reforms and the
     cell divides.
  d. The kinetochore becomes attached to the mitotic spindle. Sister
     chromatids line up at the metaphase plate. Cohesin proteins break
     down and the sister chromatids separate. The nucleus reforms and the
     cell divides.




During prophase, the “first phase,” the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate
into small vesicles, and the membranous organelles (such as the Golgi
complex or Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum), fragment and
disperse toward the periphery of the cell. The nucleolus disappears
(disperses). The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell.
Microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the
centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen.
The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin
proteins and become visible under a light microscope.
During prometaphase, the “first change phase,” many processes that were
begun in prophase continue to advance. The remnants of the nuclear
envelope fragment. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more
microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear
area. Chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. Each sister
chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the
centromeric region ([link]). The proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind
mitotic spindle microtubules. As the spindle microtubules extend from the
centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly
bind to the kinetochores. Once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the
chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids
face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached
via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. Spindle
microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar
microtubules. These microtubules overlap each other midway between the
two poles and contribute to cell elongation. Astral microtubules are located
near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation
of mitosis.




    During prometaphase, mitotic
      spindle microtubules from
  opposite poles attach to each sister
   chromatid at the kinetochore. In
  anaphase, the connection between
  the sister chromatids breaks down,
     and the microtubules pull the
    chromosomes toward opposite
                 poles.



During metaphase, the “change phase,” all the chromosomes are aligned in
a plane called the metaphase plate, or the equatorial plane, midway
between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly
attached to each other by cohesin proteins. At this time, the chromosomes
are maximally condensed.

During anaphase, the “upward phase,” the cohesin proteins degrade, and
the sister chromatids separate at the centromere. Each chromatid, now
called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its
microtubule is attached. The cell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped)
as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate
where they overlap.

During telophase, the “distance phase,” the chromosomes reach the
opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel), relaxing into a chromatin
configuration. The mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin
monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each
daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and
nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area.



Cytokinesis

Cytokinesis, or “cell motion,” is the second main stage of the mitotic phase
during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the
cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. Division is not complete
until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated
into the two daughter cells. Although the stages of mitosis are similar for
most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes
that have cell walls, such as plant cells.
In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis follows the
onset of anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just
inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin
filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure,
or “crack,” is called the cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin
ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two ([link]).

In plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During
interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins,
and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing
throughout the dividing cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles are
transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure)
at the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center
toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell plate. As more vesicles
fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the
periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated
between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. The Golgi
membranes become parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new
cell wall ([link]).




  During cytokinesis in animal cells,
    a ring of actin filaments forms at
      the metaphase plate. The ring
      contracts, forming a cleavage
    furrow, which divides the cell in
   two. In plant cells, Golgi vesicles
    coalesce at the former metaphase
   plate, forming a phragmoplast. A
   cell plate formed by the fusion of
    the vesicles of the phragmoplast
   grows from the center toward the
    cell walls, and the membranes of
   the vesicles fuse to form a plasma
   membrane that divides the cell in
                   two.




G0 Phase
Not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed
daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase,
closely followed by the mitotic phase. Cells in G0 phase are not actively
preparing to divide. The cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs
when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G0 temporarily until an
external signal triggers the onset of G1. Other cells that never or rarely
divide, such as mature cardiac muscle and nerve cells, remain in G0
permanently.

Scientific Method Connection
Determine the Time Spent in Cell Cycle Stages
Problem: How long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage
of mitosis?
Background: A prepared microscope slide of blastula cross-sections will
show cells arrested in various stages of the cell cycle. It is not visually
possible to separate the stages of interphase from each other, but the
mitotic stages are readily identifiable. If 100 cells are examined, the
number of cells in each identifiable cell cycle stage will give an estimate of
the time it takes for the cell to complete that stage.
Problem Statement: Given the events included in all of interphase and
those that take place in each stage of mitosis, estimate the length of each
stage based on a 24-hour cell cycle. Before proceeding, state your
hypothesis.
Test your hypothesis: Test your hypothesis by doing the following:

  1. Place a fixed and stained microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-
     sections under the scanning objective of a light microscope.
  2. Locate and focus on one of the sections using the scanning objective
     of your microscope. Notice that the section is a circle composed of
     dozens of closely packed individual cells.
  3. Switch to the low-power objective and refocus. With this objective,
     individual cells are visible.

  4. Switch to the high-power objective and slowly move the slide left to
     right, and up and down to view all the cells in the section ([link]). As
     you scan, you will notice that most of the cells are not undergoing
     mitosis but are in the interphase period of the cell cycle.




        Slowly scan whitefish blastula cells with the
        high-power objective as illustrated in image
           (a) to identify their mitotic stage. (b) A
         microscopic image of the scanned cells is
       shown. (credit “micrograph”: modification
       of work by Linda Flora; scale-bar data from
                     Matt Russell)


  5. Practice identifying the various stages of the cell cycle, using the
     drawings of the stages as a guide ([link]).
  6. Once you are confident about your identification, begin to record the
     stage of each cell you encounter as you scan left to right, and top to
     bottom across the blastula section.
  7. Keep a tally of your observations and stop when you reach 100 cells
     identified.
  8. The larger the sample size (total number of cells counted), the more
     accurate the results. If possible, gather and record group data prior to
     calculating percentages and making estimates.

Record your observations: Make a table similar to [link] in which you

Section Summary
The cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. Cells on the path to cell
division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated
stages. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period,
called interphase. Interphase is divided into G1, S, and G2 phases. The
mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of five
stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The
final stage of the mitotic phase is cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic
components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring
(animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).

  During G1, the cell increases in size, the genomic DNA is assessed for
  damage, and the cell stockpiles energy reserves and the components to
  synthesize DNA. During the S phase, the chromosomes, the

  phase, the cell recovers from the S phase, continues to grow, duplicates
  some organelles, and dismantles other organelles.

  by binding to tubulin (the subunit of microtubules) and interfering with
  microtubule assembly and disassembly. Exactly what mitotic structure
  is targeted by these drugs and what effect would that have on cell
  division?

  Solution:

  The mitotic spindle is formed of microtubules. Microtubules are
  polymers of the protein tubulin; therefore, it is the mitotic spindle that
  is disrupted by these drugs. Without a functional mitotic spindle, the
  chromosomes will not be sorted or separated during mitosis. The cell
  will arrest in mitosis and die.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  Describe the similarities and differences between the cytokinesis
  mechanisms found in animal cells versus those in plant cells.

  Solution:
  There are very few similarities between animal cell and plant cell
  cytokinesis. In animal cells, a ring of actin fibers is formed around the
  periphery of the cell at the former metaphase plate (cleavage furrow).
  The actin ring contracts inward, pulling the plasma membrane toward
  the center of the cell until the cell is pinched in two. In plant cells, a
  new cell wall must be formed between the daughter cells. Due to the
  rigid cell walls of the parent cell, contraction of the middle of the cell
  is not possible. Instead, a phragmoplast first forms. Subsequently, a
  cell plate is formed in the center of the cell at the former metaphase
  plate. The cell plate is formed from Golgi vesicles that contain
  enzymes, proteins, and glucose. The vesicles fuse and the enzymes
  build a new cell wall from the proteins and glucose. The cell plate
  grows toward and eventually fuses with the cell wall of the parent cell.

  Problem:

  List some reasons why a cell that has just completed cytokinesis might
  enter the G0 phase instead of the G1 phase.

  Solution:

  Many cells temporarily enter G0 until they reach maturity. Some cells
  are only triggered to enter G1 when the organism needs to increase that
  particular cell type. Some cells only reproduce following an injury to
  the tissue. Some cells never divide once they reach maturity.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  What cell cycle events will be affected in a cell that produces mutated
  (non-functional) cohesin protein?

  Solution:

  If cohesin is not functional, chromosomes are not packaged after DNA
  replication in the S phase of interphase. It is likely that the proteins of
  the centromeric region, such as the kinetochore, would not form. Even
  if the mitotic spindle fibers could attach to the chromatids without
  packing, the chromosomes would not be sorted or separated during
  mitosis.

Control of the Cell Cycle
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Understand how the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms both
     internal and external to the cell
     Explain how the three internal control checkpoints occur at the end of
     G1, at the G2/M transition, and during metaphase
     Describe the molecules that control the cell cycle through positive and
     negative regulation

The length of the cell cycle is highly variable, even within the cells of a
single organism. In humans, the frequency of cell turnover ranges from a
few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five
days for epithelial cells, and to an entire human lifetime spent in G0 by
specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. There is
also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle.
When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in culture (outside the body
under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is about 24
hours. In rapidly dividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G1
phase lasts approximately nine hours, the S phase lasts 10 hours, the G2
phase lasts about four and one-half hours, and the M phase lasts
approximately one-half hour. In early embryos of fruit flies, the cell cycle is
completed in about eight minutes. The timing of events in the cell cycle is
controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell.

Regulation of the Cell Cycle by External Events
Both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events
external to the cell when it is about to begin the replication process. An
event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the
release of growth-promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone
(HGH). A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism,
whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. Crowding of cells can also
inhibit cell division. Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size
of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing
surface-to-volume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.
Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a
series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. Moving
forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell
cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress.

Regulation at Internal Checkpoints
It is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the
parent cell. Mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes
lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced
from an abnormal cell. To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to
divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell
cycle checkpoints. A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic
cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle
can be halted until conditions are favorable. These checkpoints occur near
the end of G1, at the G2/M transition, and during metaphase ([link]).
  The cell cycle is controlled at three checkpoints. The integrity
       of the DNA is assessed at the G1 checkpoint. Proper
    chromosome duplication is assessed at the G2 checkpoint.
  Attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber is assessed at
                         the M checkpoint.




The G1 Checkpoint

The G1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell
division to proceed. The G1 checkpoint, also called the restriction point (in
yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division
process. External influences, such as growth factors, play a large role in
carrying the cell past the G1 checkpoint. In addition to adequate reserves
and cell size, there is a check for genomic DNA damage at the G1
checkpoint. A cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be
allowed to progress into the S phase. The cell can halt the cycle and attempt
to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance into G0 and
await further signals when conditions improve.



The G2 Checkpoint

The G2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are
not met. As at the G1 checkpoint, cell size and protein reserves are assessed.
However, the most important role of the G2 checkpoint is to ensure that all
of the chromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated DNA is
not damaged. If the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the DNA,
the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete DNA
replication or repair the damaged DNA.



The M Checkpoint
The M checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of
karyokinesis. The M checkpoint is also known as the spindle checkpoint,
because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly
attached to the spindle microtubules. Because the separation of the sister
chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not
proceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly
anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the
cell.

website to see an animation of the cell cycle.



Regulator Molecules of the Cell Cycle
In addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of
intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle. These regulatory
molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive
regulation) or halt the cycle (negative regulation). Regulator molecules may
act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other
regulatory proteins. Therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have
almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one mechanism
controls the same event. Conversely, the effect of a deficient or non-
functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and possibly fatal to the cell if
multiple processes are affected.
Positive Regulation of the Cell Cycle

Two groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases
(Cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various
checkpoints. The levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the
cell cycle in a predictable pattern ([link]). Increases in the concentration of
cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals. After the
cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in
the previous stage are degraded.




  The concentrations of cyclin proteins change
   throughout the cell cycle. There is a direct
  correlation between cyclin accumulation and
  the three major cell cycle checkpoints. Also
      note the sharp decline of cyclin levels
    following each checkpoint (the transition
   between phases of the cell cycle), as cyclin
      is degraded by cytoplasmic enzymes.
         (credit: modification of work by
      "WikiMiMa"/Wikimedia Commons)
Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks. To
be fully active, the Cdk/cyclin complex must also be phosphorylated in
specific locations. Like all kinases, Cdks are enzymes (kinases) that
phosphorylate other proteins. Phosphorylation activates the protein by
changing its shape. The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in
advancing the cell to the next phase. ([link]). The levels of Cdk proteins are
relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however, the concentrations of
cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk/cyclin complexes form. The
different cyclins and Cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus
regulate different checkpoints.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are
   protein kinases that, when fully
activated, can phosphorylate and thus
 activate other proteins that advance
 the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To
 become fully activated, a Cdk must
 bind to a cyclin protein and then be
  phosphorylated by another kinase.
Since the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the
cell cycle and not on specific events, regulation of the cell cycle usually
occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk/cyclin complexes.
Without a specific concentration of fully activated cyclin/Cdk complexes,
the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints.

Although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the
forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several other mechanisms
that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive,
effects. These mechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell
cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. Molecules that prevent the
full activation of Cdks are called Cdk inhibitors. Many of these inhibitor
molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell cycle event. The
block placed on Cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the
specific event that the inhibitor monitors is completed.



Negative Regulation of the Cell Cycle

The second group of cell cycle regulatory molecules are negative
regulators. Negative regulators halt the cell cycle. Remember that in
positive regulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress.

The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma
protein (Rb), p53, and p21. Retinoblastoma proteins are a group of tumor-
suppressor proteins common in many cells. The 53 and 21 designations
refer to the functional molecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons.
Much of what is known about cell cycle regulation comes from research
conducted with cells that have lost regulatory control. All three of these
regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or non-functional in
cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous). In each
case, the main cause of the unchecked progress through the cell cycle was a
faulty copy of the regulatory protein.
Rb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the G1 checkpoint. p53 is a multi-
functional protein that has a major impact on the commitment of a cell to
division because it acts when there is damaged DNA in cells that are
undergoing the preparatory processes during G1. If damaged DNA is
detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and recruits enzymes to repair the DNA. If
the DNA cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide, to
prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes. As p53 levels rise, the
production of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by
p53 by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the Cdk/cyclin complexes.
As a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21
accumulate, making it less likely that the cell will move into the S phase.

Rb exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins.
Chiefly, Rb monitors cell size. In the active, dephosphorylated state, Rb
binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, E2F ([link]).
Transcription factors “turn on” specific genes, allowing the production of
proteins encoded by that gene. When Rb is bound to E2F, production of
proteins necessary for the G1/S transition is blocked. As the cell increases in
size, Rb is slowly phosphorylated until it becomes inactivated. Rb releases
E2F, which can now turn on the gene that produces the transition protein,
and this particular block is removed. For the cell to move past each of the
checkpoints, all positive regulators must be “turned on,” and all negative
regulators must be “turned off.”

Rb and other proteins that negatively regulate the cell cycle are sometimes
called tumor suppressors. Why do you think the name tumor suppressor
might be appropriate for these proteins?



Section Summary
Each step of the cell cycle is monitored by internal controls called
checkpoints. There are three major checkpoints in the cell cycle: one near
the end of G1, a second at the G2/M transition, and the third during
metaphase. Positive regulator molecules allow the cell cycle to advance to
the next stage. Negative regulator molecules monitor cellular conditions
and can halt the cycle until specific requirements are met.

  Rb is a negative regulator that blocks the cell cycle at the G1

  Solution:

  Rb is active when it is dephosphorylated. In this state, Rb binds to E2F,
  which is a transcription factor required for the transcription and
  eventual translation of molecules required for the G1/S transition. E2F
  cannot transcribe certain genes when it is bound to Rb. As the cell
  increases in size, Rb becomes phosphorylated, inactivated, and
  releases E2F. E2F can then promote the transcription of the genes it
  controls, and the transition proteins will be produced.

Cancer and the Cell Cycle
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe how cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell growth
     Understand how proto-oncogenes are normal cell genes that, when
     mutated, become oncogenes
     Describe how tumor suppressors function
     Explain how mutant tumor suppressors cause cancer

Cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common
mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. Despite the redundancy and
overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. One of the critical
processes monitored by the cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is
the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell
cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors
(mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If changes to the DNA
nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not
corrected, a gene mutation results. All cancers start when a gene mutation
gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction. The
change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor:
perhaps a slight delay in the binding of Cdk to cyclin or an Rb protein that
detaches from its target DNA while still phosphorylated. Even minor
mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily.
Over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to
the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-
functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of
the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair
mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces
the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (“-oma”) can result.

Proto-oncogenes
The genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-
oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated in certain
ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous.
Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently
acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence
will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is
detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the
cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will
not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not
propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene
mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator.
For example, a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being
partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all
of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter cells are too
damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be
propagated and no harm would come to the organism. However, if the
atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent
generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some
possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.

The Cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are
considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell cycle regulatory
proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way
as to override cell cycle checkpoints. An oncogene is any gene that, when
altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression.

Tumor Suppressor Genes
Like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins
were discovered in cells that had become cancerous. Tumor suppressor
genes are segments of DNA that code for negative regulator proteins, the
type of regulators that, when activated, can prevent the cell from
undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-
understood tumor suppressor gene proteins, Rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a
roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed. A
cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to
halt the cell cycle if there is a problem. Tumor suppressors are similar to
brakes in a vehicle: Malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash.

Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than one-half of all human
tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in light of the multiple roles
that the p53 protein plays at the G1 checkpoint. A cell with a faulty p53 may
fail to detect errors present in the genomic DNA ([link]). Even if a partially
functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to
signal the necessary DNA repair enzymes. Either way, damaged DNA will
remain uncorrected. At this point, a functional p53 will deem the cell
unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). The damaged
version of p53 found in cancer cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis.



Note:
Art Connection




       The role of normal p53 is to monitor DNA and the
     supply of oxygen (hypoxia is a condition of reduced
      oxygen supply). If damage is detected, p53 triggers
      repair mechanisms. If repairs are unsuccessful, p53
    signals apoptosis. A cell with an abnormal p53 protein
      cannot repair damaged DNA and thus cannot signal
        apoptosis. Cells with abnormal p53 can become
     cancerous. (credit: modification of work by Thierry
                           Soussi)


Human papillomavirus can cause cervical cancer. The virus encodes E6, a
protein that binds p53. Based on this fact and what you know about p53,
what effect do you think E6 binding has on p53 activity?

  a. E6 activates p53
  b. E6 inactivates p53
  c. E6 mutates p53
  d. E6 binding marks p53 for degradation




The loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle. Mutated
p53 might lose its ability to trigger p21 production. Without adequate levels
of p21, there is no effective block on Cdk activation. Essentially, without a
fully functional p53, the G1 checkpoint is severely compromised and the
cell proceeds directly from G1 to S regardless of internal and external
conditions. At the completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter
cells are produced that have inherited the mutated p53 gene. Given the non-
optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that
the daughter cells will have acquired other mutations in addition to the
faulty tumor suppressor gene. Cells such as these daughter cells quickly
accumulate both oncogenes and non-functional tumor suppressor genes.
Again, the result is tumor growth.

Section Summary
Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of
the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle. The loss of control begins with
a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the
regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not
function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow
other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell
division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated
damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly
reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia
(blood cancer).

  oncogene. A tumor suppressor gene is a segment of DNA that codes
  for one of the negative cell cycle regulators. If that gene becomes
  mutated so that the protein product becomes less active, the cell cycle
  will run unchecked. A single oncogene can initiate abnormal cell
  divisions; however, tumor suppressors lose their effectiveness only
  when both copies of the gene are damaged.

  Problem:

  List the regulatory mechanisms that might be lost in a cell producing
  faulty p53.

  Solution:
  Regulatory mechanisms that might be lost include monitoring of the
  quality of the genomic DNA, recruiting of repair enzymes, and the
  triggering of apoptosis.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  p53 can trigger apoptosis if certain cell cycle events fail. How does
  this regulatory outcome benefit a multicellular organism?

  Solution:

  If a cell has damaged DNA, the likelihood of producing faulty proteins
  is higher. The daughter cells of such a damaged parent cell would also
  produce faulty proteins that might eventually become cancerous. If
  p53 recognizes this damage and triggers the cell to self-destruct, the
  damaged DNA is degraded and recycled. No further harm comes to the
  organism. Another healthy cell is triggered to divide instead.

Propagation of the Signal
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain how the binding of a ligand initiates signal transduction
     throughout a cell
     Recognize the role of phosphorylation in the transmission of
     intracellular signals
     Evaluate the role of second messengers in signal transmission

Once a ligand binds to a receptor, the signal is transmitted through the
membrane and into the cytoplasm. Continuation of a signal in this manner
is called signal transduction. Signal transduction only occurs with cell-
surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with
DNA in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis.

When a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that
affect the receptor’s intracellular domain. Conformational changes of the
extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the
membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular
domain or its associated proteins. In some cases, binding of the ligand
causes dimerization of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind
to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. A dimer is a
chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join
together. The binding of the receptors in this manner enables their
intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other.

Binding Initiates a Signaling Pathway
After the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the
receptor’s intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a
signaling pathway or a signaling cascade. In a signaling pathway, second
messengers, enzymes, and activated proteins interact with specific proteins,
which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a
change in the cell’s environment ([link]). The events in the cascade occur in
a series, much like a current flows in a river. Interactions that occur before a
certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are
called downstream events.

   The epidermal growth factor
   (EGF) receptor (EGFR) is a
     receptor tyrosine kinase
   involved in the regulation of
   cell growth, wound healing,
   and tissue repair. When EGF
  binds to the EGFR, a cascade
  of downstream events causes
  the cell to grow and divide. If
       EGFR is activated at
       inappropriate times,
     uncontrolled cell growth
       (cancer) may occur.


In certain cancers, the GTPase activity of the RAS G-protein is inhibited.
This means that the RAS protein can no longer hydrolyze GTP into GDP.
What effect would this have on downstream cellular events?



Signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most
cellular proteins can affect different downstream events, depending on the
conditions within the cell. A single pathway can branch off toward different
endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways,
and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different
cell types. This variation in response is due to differences in protein
expression in different cell types. Another complicating element is signal
integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different
cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. This
process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell
commits to a specific response.

The effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic
cascades. At the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single
receptor. However, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate
many copies of a component of the signaling cascade, which amplifies the
signal.

Methods of Intracellular Signaling
The induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a
cellular component by an enzyme. There are numerous enzymatic
modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next
component downstream. The following are some of the more common
events in intracellular signaling.
Note:

Phosphorylation

One of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling
pathways is the addition of a phosphate group (PO4–3) to a molecule such as
a protein in a process called phosphorylation. The phosphate can be added
to a nucleotide such as GMP to form GDP or GTP. Phosphates are also
often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where
they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid ([link]). The transfer of
the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase. Various kinases
are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. Phosphorylation of serine
and threonine residues often activates enzymes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine
residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site
that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade.
Phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of
phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the
effect.
  In protein phosphorylation, a
   phosphate group (PO4-3 ) is
     added to residues of the
  amino acids serine, threonine,
          and tyrosine.




Second Messengers

Second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has
been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor.
These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering
the behavior of certain cellular proteins.

Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of
calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the
plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to
remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles,
such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When
signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels
of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage
compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of
cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending
on the cell type involved. For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+
signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in
Ca2+ leads to muscle contractions.

Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic
AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase
from ATP ([link]). The main role of cAMP in cells is to bind to and activate
an enzyme called cAMP-dependent kinase (A-kinase). A-kinase regulates
many vital metabolic pathways: It phosphorylates serine and threonine
residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. A-kinase is
found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind
of cell are different. Differences give rise to the variation of the responses to
cAMP in different cells.




      This diagram shows the mechanism for the
   formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP serves
    as a second messenger to activate or inactivate
   proteins within the cell. Termination of the signal
   occurs when an enzyme called phosphodiesterase
              converts cAMP into AMP.
Present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane, inositol
phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers.
Because these molecules are membrane components, they are located near
membrane-bound receptors and can easily interact with them.
Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is the main phospholipid that plays a role in
cellular signaling. Enzymes known as kinases phosphorylate PI to form PI-
phosphate (PIP) and PI-bisphosphate (PIP2).

The enzyme phospholipase C cleaves PIP2 to form diacylglycerol (DAG)
and inositol triphosphate (IP3) ([link]). These products of the cleavage of
PIP2 serve as second messengers. Diacylglycerol (DAG) remains in the
plasma membrane and activates protein kinase C (PKC), which then
phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in its target proteins. IP3
diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to ligand-gated calcium channels in
the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ that continues the signal cascade.




  The enzyme phospholipase C breaks down
  PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, both of which serve
              as second messengers.




Section Summary
Ligand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction through the
cell. The chain of events that conveys the signal through the cell is called a
signaling pathway or cascade. Signaling pathways are often very complex
because of the interplay between different proteins. A major component of
cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes
known as kinases. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine,
threonine, and tyrosine residues in a protein, changing their shapes, and
activating or inactivating the protein. Small molecules like nucleotides can
also be phosphorylated. Second messengers are small, non-protein
molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell. Some examples of
second messengers are calcium ions (Ca2+), cyclic AMP (cAMP),
diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol triphosphate (IP3).

  The same second messengers are used in many different cells, but the

  possible?

  Solution:

  Different cells produce different proteins, including cell-surface

  to different ligands, and the second messengers activate different
  pathways. Signal integration can also change the end result of
  signaling.

Response to the Signal
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe how signaling pathways direct protein expression, cellular
     metabolism, and cell growth
     Identify the function of PKC in signal transduction pathways
     Recognize the role of apoptosis in the development and maintenance
     of a healthy organism

Inside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to
directly affect the cell’s DNA and protein-producing machinery. Using
signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a
variety of effects on the cell. The results of signaling pathways are
extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the
external and internal conditions. A small sampling of responses is described
below.

Gene Expression
Some signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of RNA.
Others regulate the translation of proteins from mRNA. An example of a
protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the MAP kinase ERK.
ERK is activated in a phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth
factor (EGF) binds the EGF receptor (see [link]). Upon phosphorylation,
ERK enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that, in turn, regulates
protein translation ([link]).
       ERK is a MAP kinase that
     activates translation when it is
          phosphorylated. ERK
   phosphorylates MNK1, which in
    turn phosphorylates eIF-4E, an
    elongation initiation factor that,
     with other initiation factors, is
     associated with mRNA. When
   eIF-4E becomes phosphorylated,
      the mRNA unfolds, allowing
   protein synthesis in the nucleus to
        begin. (See [link] for the
     phosphorylation pathway that
             activates ERK.)



The second kind of protein with which PKC can interact is a protein that
acts as an inhibitor. An inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and
prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. In this case, the
inhibitor is a protein called Iκ-B, which binds to the regulatory protein NF-
κB. (The symbol κ represents the Greek letter kappa.) When Iκ-B is bound
to NF-κB, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when Iκ-B
is phosphorylated by PKC, it can no longer bind NF-κB, and NF-κB (a
transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate RNA transcription. In
this case, the effect of phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and
thereby activate the process of transcription.

Increase in Cellular Metabolism
The result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. The activation
of β-adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by adrenaline leads to an increase
in cyclic AMP (cAMP) inside the cell. Also known as epinephrine,
adrenaline is a hormone (produced by the adrenal gland attached to the
kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. Cyclic AMP
activates PKA (protein kinase A), which in turn phosphorylates two
enzymes. The first enzyme promotes the degradation of glycogen by
activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) that in turn
activates glycogen phosphorylase (GP) that catabolizes glycogen into
glucose. (Recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for
short-term storage. When energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted
to glucose.) Phosphorylation of the second enzyme, glycogen synthase
(GS), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. In this manner, a
muscle cell obtains a ready pool of glucose by activating its formation via
glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form
glycogen, thus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and
synthesis. The glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in
response to a sudden surge of adrenaline—the “fight or flight” reflex.

Cell Growth
Cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. Cells do not
normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells. The
ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors. Most growth
factors bind to cell-surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases.
These cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).
Activation of RTKs initiates a signaling pathway that includes a G-protein
called RAS, which activates the MAP kinase pathway described earlier. The
enzyme MAP kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact
with other cellular components to initiate cell division.



Note:
Career Connection
Cancer Biologist
Cancer biologists study the molecular origins of cancer with the goal of
developing new prevention methods and treatment strategies that will
inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the body.
As mentioned earlier, signaling pathways control cell growth. These
signaling pathways are controlled by signaling proteins, which are, in turn,
expressed by genes. Mutations in these genes can result in malfunctioning
signaling proteins. This prevents the cell from regulating its cell cycle,
triggering unrestricted cell division and cancer. The genes that regulate the
signaling proteins are one type of oncogene which is a gene that has the
potential to cause cancer. The gene encoding RAS is an oncogene that was
originally discovered when mutations in the RAS protein were linked to
cancer. Further studies have indicated that 30 percent of cancer cells have a
mutation in the RAS gene that leads to uncontrolled growth. If left
unchecked, uncontrolled cell division can lead tumor formation and
metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in new locations in the body.
Cancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that
contribute to the development of cancer. For example, HER2 is a cell-
surface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent of
human breast cancers. Cancer biologists realized that gene duplication led
to HER2 overexpression in 25 percent of breast cancer patients and
developed a drug called Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is a
monoclonal antibody that targets HER2 for removal by the immune
system. Herceptin therapy helps to control signaling through HER2. The
use of Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to increase
the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Cancer Institute website
(http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/targetedtherapie
s).



Cell Death
When a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an
organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death,
or apoptosis. Apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that
prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell.
There are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cell’s health; if
abnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of
apoptosis. However, in some cases, such as a viral infection or uncontrolled
cell division due to cancer, the cell’s normal checks and balances fail.
External signaling can also initiate apoptosis. For example, most normal
animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a
network of glycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an
organism. The binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular matrix
initiates a signaling cascade within the cell. However, if the cell moves
away from the extracellular matrix, the signaling ceases, and the cell
undergoes apoptosis. This system keeps cells from traveling through the
body and proliferating out of control, as happens with tumor cells that
metastasize.

Another example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in T-
cell development. T-cells are immune cells that bind to foreign
macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the
immune system. Normally, T-cells do not target “self” proteins (those of
their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. In
order to develop the ability to discriminate between self and non-self,
immature T-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind to so-
called self proteins. If the T-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell
initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially dangerous cell.

Apoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development. In
vertebrates, for example, early stages of development include the formation
of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes ([link]). During the
course of normal development, these unneeded cells must be eliminated,
enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form. A cell signaling
mechanism triggers apoptosis, which destroys the cells between the
developing digits.




    The histological
  section of a foot of
  a 15-day-old mouse
  embryo, visualized
       using light
  microscopy, reveals
     areas of tissue
   between the toes,
    which apoptosis
     will eliminate
   before the mouse
     reaches its full
   gestational age at
    27 days. (credit:

    work by Michal
       Mañas)


Termination of the Signal Cascade
The aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination
of a signal at the appropriate time can be just as important as the initiation
of a signal. One method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the
ligand or remove it so that it can no longer access its receptor. One reason
that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-
lasting events is because they bind carrier proteins. These proteins allow the
insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but they also protect the
hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes.

Inside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications
that result from signaling cascades. For example, phosphatases are
enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in
a process called dephosphorylation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is degraded into
AMP by phosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is reversed
by the Ca2+ pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes
of the cell.

Section Summary
The initiation of a signaling pathway is a response to external stimuli. This
response can take many different forms, including protein synthesis, a
change in the cell’s metabolism, cell growth, or even cell death. Many
pathways influence the cell by initiating gene expression, and the methods
utilized are quite numerous. Some pathways activate enzymes that interact
with DNA transcription factors. Others modify proteins and induce them to
change their location in the cell. Depending on the status of the organism,
cells can respond by storing energy as glycogen or fat, or making it
available in the form of glucose. A signal transduction pathway allows
muscle cells to respond to immediate requirements for energy in the form of
glucose. Cell growth is almost always stimulated by external signals called
growth factors. Uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer, and mutations in
the genes encoding protein components of signaling pathways are often
found in tumor cells. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is important for
removing damaged or unnecessary cells. The use of cellular signaling to
organize the dismantling of a cell ensures that harmful molecules from the
cytoplasm are not released into the spaces between cells, as they are in
uncontrolled death, necrosis. Apoptosis also ensures the efficient recycling
of the components of the dead cell. Termination of the cellular signaling
cascade is very important so that the response to a signal is appropriate in
both timing and intensity. Degradation of signaling molecules and
dephosphorylation of phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway by
phosphatases are two ways to terminate signals within the cell.

  Solution:

  If a kinase is mutated so that it is always activated, it will continuously

  possibly cancer. If a kinase is mutated so that it cannot function, the
  cell will not respond to ligand binding.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  How does the extracellular matrix control the growth of cells?

  Solution:

  Receptors on the cell surface must be in contact with the extracellular
  matrix in order to receive positive signals that allow the cell to live. If
  the receptors are not activated by binding, the cell will undergo
  apoptosis. This ensures that cells are in the correct place in the body
  and helps to prevent invasive cell growth as occurs in metastasis in
  cancer.

Mario Caoechhi

Mario R. Capecchi, Ph.D., of the University of Utah, won the 2007 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Capecchi shared the prize with Oliver
Smithies of University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Sir Martin
Evans of Cardiff University in the UK.

The prize recognized Capecchi's pioneering work on "knockout mouse"
technology, a gene-targeting technique that has revolutionized genetic and
biomedical research, allowing scientists to create animal models for
hundreds of human diseases.

As a child, Capecchi wandered homeless in Italy. As a researcher, his first
attempts at gene targeting were deemed not ready for funding by the
National Institutes of Health. Capecchi is an individual whose personal life
proves that while some events are not probable, anything is possible. Read
Mario's story.

During the 1980s, Capecchi devised a way to change or remove any single
gene in the mouse genome, creating strains of mice that pass the altered
gene from parent to offspring. In the years since, these "transgenic" and
"knockout" mice have become commonplace in the laboratory.

Capecchi's pioneering work in gene targeting has taught us much about how
the body builds—and rebuilds—itself. He has given scientists worldwide
the tools to make important discoveries about human diseases, from cancer
to obesity.

And he has raised a key question for the future of human medicine: if we
can replace a perfectly good gene with a mutated one, can we also go the
other way, replacing problem genes with those that work?



Mario’s Lab at Work

What makes an arm an arm? Capecchi's research team is working on
answering that question using gene targeting. They have systematically
"knocked out" a set of genes in mice, called homeotic genes, which govern
body patterning during development. For example, one of the lab's most
recent genetic discoveries may explain why we lack spare ribs. Find out
more about how homeotic genes work inGenes Determine Body Patterns.

YOUR GOAL: You are studying how a particular gene, named OhNo,
might play a role in panic attacks. You want to study mice that are missing
this gene. To "knockout" the OhNo gene, you will replace it with a mutated
copy that doesn't work.

Here's how:

1. Isolate Stem Cells

Isolate embryonic stem cells that originated from male brown mice with a
normal OhNo gene (blue).

2. Add Inactive Gene With Marker

To these cells, add a copy containing a mutated, inactive OhNo gene (red),
and a drug resistance marker gene (p3. Similar Genes Naturally Swap

3. Similar Genes Naturally Swap

By mechanisms that are not completely understood yet, similar genes will
swap places. The OhNo gene plus drug resistance marker gene is
incorporated into the genome, and the normal version is kicked out. This
process is called homologous recombination.

ink).

4. Add Drug

Cells that haven't incorporated the inactive OhNo gene don't have the drug
resistance marker gene (pink).

Adding the drug kills cells without the marker, leaving you with only cells
that have an inactive version of the OhNo gene.

5. Grow Chimeric Mice

By transplanting stem cells that carry the inactive ohNo gene into a white
mouse embyro, you'll create what is called a chimera. Chimeras have
patches of cells throughout their bodies that grew from white mouse cells
and patches that grew from brown stem cells. Some of the cells that have
the inactive OhNo gene may develop into reproductive cells.

Chimeras are easy to identify because they have both brown and white
patches of fur.

6. Mate Male Chimera

If a male chimera has some reproductive cells (sperm) that originated from
the brown stem cells, he will produce some brown offspring when mated
with a white female.

7. Test and Breed Brown Offspring

Half of the brown offspring will have a copy of the inactive OhNo gene in
all of their cells—including their reproductive cells. These mice have one
normal copy of the OhNo gene from their

mother (not shown) and one inactive copy from their father. So half of their
reproductive cells will contain a normal copy, and half will contain an
inactive copy.
These mice can be identified by performing DNA sequencing in their OhNo
genes and then bred with each other.

Genomics and Proteomics
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain systems biology
     Describe a proteome
     Define protein signature

Proteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function
encoded by the gene. Proteins are composed of amino acids and play
important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that
act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory
molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as
hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that
defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state,
protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or
because of direct impact on a specific protein.

A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes
can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for
mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. Although mRNA analysis is a
step in the right direction, not all mRNAs are translated into proteins. The
study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics. Proteomics
complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their
hypotheses that were based on genes. Even though all cells of a
multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins
produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression.
Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic
within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternately spliced (cut and
pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins
are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage,
phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. There are also protein-
protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. Although the
genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several
factors that can change the progression of events that generate the
proteome.

Metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics
involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism. The
metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the
genetic makeup of an organism. Metabolomics offers an opportunity to
compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic
makeup and environmental factors. The goal of metabolome research is to
identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the metabolites that are found in the
tissues and fluids of living organisms.

Basic Techniques in Protein Analysis
The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins
expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the
interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell
behavior or develop drug targets. Just as the genome is analyzed using the
basic technique of DNA sequencing, proteomics requires techniques for
protein analysis. The basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to
DNA sequencing, is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is used to
identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. Advances in
spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small samples of
protein. X-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine
the three-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution.
Another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional
structure of proteins in aqueous solution. Protein microarrays have also
been used to study interactions between proteins. Large-scale adaptations of
the basic two-hybrid screen ([link]) have provided the basis for protein
microarrays. Computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data
generated for proteomic analysis.

Genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology.
Systems biology is the study of whole biological systems (genomes and
proteomes) based on interactions within the system. The European
Bioinformatics Institute and the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) are
developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous
pile of systems biology data. Because proteins are the direct products of
genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes
to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and
genes involved in disease processes. Most pharmaceutical drug trials target
proteins. Information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify
novel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action.




      Two-hybrid screening is used to
       determine whether two proteins
          interact. In this method, a
      transcription factor is split into a
     DNA-binding domain (BD) and an
   activator domain (AD). The binding
  domain is able to bind the promoter in
    the absence of the activator domain,
  but it does not turn on transcription. A
    protein called the bait is attached to
   the BD, and a protein called the prey
    is attached to the AD. Transcription
   occurs only if the prey “catches” the
                      bait.
The challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in
detecting small quantities of proteins. Although mass spectrometry is good
for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in
diseased states can be difficult to discern. Proteins are naturally unstable
molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than
genomic analysis.

Cancer Proteomics
Genomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are
being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease. The most
prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer.
Proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early
detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose
expression is affected by the disease process. An individual protein is called
a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is
called a protein signature. For a biomarker or protein signature to be
useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must
be secreted in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or urine, such that large-
scale screenings can be performed in a non-invasive fashion. The current
problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high
rate of false-negative results. A false negative is an incorrect test result that
should have been positive. In other words, many cases of cancer go
undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some examples of protein
biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and
PSA for prostate cancer. Protein signatures may be more reliable than
biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop
individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or
not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the
individual may experience. Proteomics is also being used to predict the
possibility of disease recurrence.

The National Cancer Institute has developed programs to improve the
detection and treatment of cancer. The Clinical Proteomic Technologies for
Cancer and the Early Detection Research Network are efforts to identify
protein signatures specific to different types of cancers. The Biomedical
Proteomics Program is designed to identify protein signatures and design
effective therapies for cancer patients.

Section Summary
Proteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given
type of cell under certain environmental conditions. In a multicellular
organism, different cell types will have different proteomes, and these will
vary with changes in the environment. Unlike a genome, a proteome is
dynamic and in constant flux, which makes it both more complicated and
more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone.

Proteomics approaches rely on protein analysis; these techniques are
constantly being upgraded. Proteomics has been used to study different
types of cancer. Different biomarkers and protein signatures are being used
to analyze each type of cancer. The future goal is to have a personalized
treatment plan for each individual.

Applying Genomics
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Explain pharmacogenomics
     Define polygenic

The introduction of DNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing
projects, particularly the Human Genome project, has expanded the
applicability of DNA sequence information. Genomics is now being used in
a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and
mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of
genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.

Predicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level
Predicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy
individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Intervention with
lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset.
However, this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within
a single gene defect. Such defects only account for approximately 5 percent
of diseases in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as
heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic
characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve
environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010, scientists at Stanford
University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen
Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced);
the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. A risk
assessment was performed to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55
different medical conditions. A rare genetic mutation was found, which
showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to
have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk
of developing Alzheimer’s. The scientists used databases and several
publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing
is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more
reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level
remain to be addressed.
Note:

  PCA3 is a gene that is expressed in
      prostate epithelial cells and
   overexpressed in cancerous cells.
   A high concentration of PCA3 in
     urine is indicative of prostate
       cancer. The PCA3 test is
  considered to be a better indicator
  of cancer than the more well know
  PSA test, which measures the level
  of PSA (prostate-specific antigen)
              in the blood.


In 2011, the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommended
against using the PSA test to screen healthy men for prostate cancer. Their
recommendation is based on evidence that screening does not reduce the
risk of death from prostate cancer. Prostate cancer often develops very
slowly and does not cause problems, while the cancer treatment can have
severe side effects. The PCA3 test is considered to be more accurate, but
screening may still result in men who would not have been harmed by the
cancer itself suffering side effects from treatment. What do you think?
Should all healthy men be screened for prostate cancer using the PCA3 or
PSA test? Should people in general be screened to find out if they have a
genetic risk for cancer or other diseases?



Pharmacogenomics and Toxicogenomics
Pharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the
effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an
individual's genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied
using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in
the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes
in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile
in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the
potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth
and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of
cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes
involved in drug toxicity. Personal genome sequence information can be
used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on
the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. The gene signatures may not
be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic
symptoms arise.

Microbial Genomics: Metagenomics
Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that
microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which
involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory.
Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of
hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory
environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species
resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as
isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of
these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study
microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of
multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche.
Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to
analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment ([link]).




  Metagenomics involves isolating
  DNA from multiple species within
     an environmental niche.




Microbial Genomics: Creation of New Biofuels
Knowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better
ways to harness biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria. The primary
sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as
ethanol. Although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to
find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our population’s
energy demands. The microbial world is one of the largest resources for
genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and
it remains largely untapped. Microorganisms are used to create products,
such as enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-
microbial mechanisms. Microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic
tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced
environmental cleanup techniques.

Mitochondrial Genomics
Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own DNA.
Mitochondrial DNA mutates at a rapid rate and is often used to study
evolutionary relationships. Another feature that makes studying the
mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial DNA in most
multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of
fertilization. For this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace
genealogy.

Information and clues obtained from DNA samples found at crime scenes
have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been
used in forensic analysis. Genomic analysis has also become useful in this
field. In 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published. It was a
collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and the FBI to
solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the US Postal
Service. Using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific
strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings.

Genomics in Agriculture
Genomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research
to a certain extent, which could improve the quality and quantity of crop
yields in agriculture. Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to
improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities.
Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer
those traits to a different organism. Scientists are discovering how genomics
can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For
example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or
enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more
tolerant of the dry season.

Section Summary
Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics
is being applied to most fields of biology; it is being used for personalized
medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of
drug interactions before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of
microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also
being applied to developments such as the generation of new biofuels,
genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science,
and improvements in agriculture.

  [link] There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. While it
  is true that prostate cancer treatment itself can be harmful, many men
  would rather be aware that they have cancer so they can monitor the
  disease and begin treatment if it progresses. And while genetic
  screening may be useful, it is expensive and may cause needless worry.
  People with certain risk factors may never develop the disease, and
  preventative treatments may do more harm than good.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Describe gel electrophoresis
     Explain molecular and reproductive cloning
     Describe uses of biotechnology in medicine and agriculture

Biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological
advancement. Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops
long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. Since
the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, the field of biotechnology
has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies.
The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of
vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops,
such as to increase yields). Biotechnology also has many industrial
applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the
production of biofuels ([link]).




      Antibiotics are chemicals produced by fungi,
         bacteria, and other organisms that have
      antimicrobial properties. The first antibiotic
     discovered was penicillin. Antibiotics are now
       commercially produced and tested for their
       potential to inhibit bacterial growth. (credit

Basic Techniques to Manipulate Genetic Material (DNA and
RNA)
To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids,
remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a
sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester
bonds. The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative
charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus is called the
genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds
between the paired bases. The two strands can be separated by exposure to
high temperatures (DNA denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling.
The DNA can be replicated by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Unlike DNA,
which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave
the nucleus. The most common type of RNA that is analyzed is the
messenger RNA (mRNA) because it represents the protein-coding genes
that are actively expressed. However, RNA molecules present some other
challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than DNA.



DNA and RNA Extraction

To study or manipulate nucleic acids, the DNA or RNA must first be
isolated or extracted from the cells. Various techniques are used to extract
different types of DNA ([link]). Most nucleic acid extraction techniques
involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy
all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted
molecules and separation from the DNA sample). Cells are broken using a
lysis buffer (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means “to split.”
These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and
nuclear membranes. Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as
proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases (RNAses) that
break down RNA. The DNA is then precipitated using alcohol. Human
genomic DNA is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. The DNA
samples can be stored frozen at –80°C for several years.
    This diagram shows the basic method used for
                extraction of DNA.



RNA analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. RNA
is naturally very unstable because RNAses are commonly present in nature
and very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA, RNA extraction involves
the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and
preserve the RNA.



Gel Electrophoresis

Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in
an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field. Gel
electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of
size, using this charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole
chromosomes or fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the
negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the
positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. Smaller molecules move
through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in
the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. There are
molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules
to provide a size comparison. Nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed
using various fluorescent or colored dyes. Distinct nucleic acid fragments
appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative
electrode end) on the basis of their size ([link]). A mixture of genomic
DNA fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut
genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single
large band at the top of the gel.




     Shown are DNA fragments
    from seven samples run on a
   gel, stained with a fluorescent
     dye, and viewed under UV
     light. (credit: James Jacob,
  Tompkins Cortland Community
               College)
Amplification of Nucleic Acid Fragments by Polymerase Chain
Reaction

Although genomic DNA is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in
bulk, DNA analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions
of the genome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to
amplify specific regions of DNA for further analysis ([link]). PCR is used
for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of gene fragments to
analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign DNA in a
sample, and the amplification of DNA for sequencing. More practical
applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic
diseases.
 Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is used to amplify a
specific sequence of DNA. Primers—short pieces of DNA
  complementary to each end of the target sequence—are
   combined with genomic DNA, Taq polymerase, and
 deoxynucleotides. Taq polymerase is a DNA polymerase
     isolated from the thermostable bacterium Thermus
 aquaticus that is able to withstand the high temperatures
   used in PCR. Thermus aquaticus grows in the Lower
   Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park. Reverse
transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is similar to PCR, but cDNA
    is made from an RNA template before PCR begins.
DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process
called reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The first step is to recreate
the original DNA template strand (called cDNA) by applying DNA
nucleotides to the mRNA. This process is called reverse transcription. This
requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. After the
cDNA is made, regular PCR can be used to amplify it.

Hybridization, Southern Blotting, and Northern Blotting

Nucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic DNA and RNA extracts,
can be probed for the presence of certain sequences. Short DNA fragments
called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes
to aid detection. Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments
according to their size. The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a
nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting ([link]). The nucleic acid
fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed
with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences. When
DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called Southern
blotting, and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane, it is called
northern blotting. Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain
DNA sequences in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect
gene expression.
     Southern blotting is used to find a particular
  sequence in a sample of DNA. DNA fragments are
       separated on a gel, transferred to a nylon
     membrane, and incubated with a DNA probe
      complementary to the sequence of interest.
   Northern blotting is similar to Southern blotting,
    but RNA is run on the gel instead of DNA. In
    western blotting, proteins are run on a gel and
              detected using antibodies.




Molecular Cloning
In general, the word “cloning” means the creation of a perfect replica;
however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as
“reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire
organism, researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or
fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.

Cloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and
study of specific genes (and their protein products), or noncoding regions in
isolation. A plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular DNA molecule
that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA. In cloning, the
plasmid molecules can be used to provide a "folder" in which to insert a
desired DNA fragment. Plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host
for proliferation. In the bacterial context, the fragment of DNA from the
human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is
referred to as foreign DNA, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the DNA
of the bacterium, which is called the host DNA.

Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as Escherichia coli)
and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as
antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids
have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and
the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human
growth hormone. An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with
which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning
site (MCS). The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites
that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases.
Restriction endonucleases recognize specific DNA sequences and cut
them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a
defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction endonucleases
make staggered cuts in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have
a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. Because these overhangs are
capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called
“sticky ends.” Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase permanently joins
the DNA fragments via phosphodiester bonds. In this way, any DNA
fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced
between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same
restriction endonuclease ([link]).



Recombinant DNA Molecules

Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant
DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in
nature. They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of
different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of
biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. Proteins that are
expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant
proteins. Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes.
The recombinant DNA may need to be moved into a different vector (or
host) that is better designed for gene expression. Plasmids may also be
engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain
environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the
recombinant proteins.

Cellular Cloning
Unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones
of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known
as cellular cloning. The nuclear DNA duplicates by the process of mitosis,
which creates an exact replica of the genetic material.

Reproductive Cloning
Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical
copy of an entire multicellular organism. Most multicellular organisms
undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic
hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for
generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances
in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual
reproduction of mammals in the laboratory.

Parthenogenesis, or “virgin birth,” occurs when an embryo grows and
develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of
asexual reproduction. An example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in
which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg
and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it
remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. The unfertilized egg is
called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. Some insects and reptiles lay
parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults.

Sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm
cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. The zygote nucleus contains the genetic
information to produce a new individual. However, early embryonic
development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell.
This idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. Therefore, if the haploid
nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any
individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that
is genetically identical to the donor. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is the
technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. It can be
used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning.

The first cloned animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The
success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived
for seven years and died of respiratory complications ([link]). There is
speculation that because the cell DNA belongs to an older individual, the
age of the DNA may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. Since
Dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been
successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb,
and cardiac abnormalities. There have been attempts at producing cloned
human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to
as cloning for therapeutic purposes. Therapeutic cloning produces stem
cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike
reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). Still,
therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical
considerations.

Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism’s genotype using
recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism’s DNA to achieve
desirable traits. The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant
DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method
of genetic engineering. The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is
called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is
introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called
transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified
since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial
purposes. In the US, GMOs such as Roundup-ready soybeans and borer-
resistant corn are part of many common processed foods.



Gene Targeting

Although classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a
given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype,
modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and
ask: "What does this gene or DNA element do?" This technique, called
reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology.
This method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its
function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the
function of the wing is flight. The classical genetic method would compare
insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-
flying insects have lost wings. Similarly, mutating or deleting genes
provides researchers with clues about gene function. The methods used to
disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting. Gene targeting
is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular
gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the
expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence
from the genome of an organism.

Biotechnology in Medicine and Agriculture
It is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes.
Knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of
heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix
mutant genes provides methods to treat the disease. Biotechnology in
agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental
stress, and improve both crop yield and quality.



Genetic Diagnosis and Gene Therapy

The process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering
treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing. Depending on the
inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised
to undergo genetic testing. For example, women diagnosed with breast
cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can
determine the genetic basis of cancer development. Treatment plans are
based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. If
the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are
also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast
cancer. Genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro
fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes
in families with specific debilitating diseases.

Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. In its
simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random
location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a
mutated gene. The good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as
part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and
deliver the foreign DNA ([link]). More advanced forms of gene therapy try
to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case
with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).




   Gene therapy using an adenovirus vector can be used to
    cure certain genetic diseases in which a person has a
                defective gene. (credit: NIH)




Production of Vaccines, Antibiotics, and Hormones
Traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of
microorganisms to mount the initial immune response. Modern techniques
use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the
desired antigen. The antigen is then introduced into the body to stimulate
the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. Genes cloned
from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing
strains of this virus.

Antibiotics are a biotechnological product. They are naturally produced by
microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial
populations. Antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and
manipulating fungal cells.

Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce large-scale quantities
of human insulin in E. coli as early as 1978. Previously, it was only possible
to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans
because of differences in the gene product. In addition, human growth
hormone (HGH) is used to treat growth disorders in children. The HGH
gene was cloned from a cDNA library and inserted into E. coli cells by
cloning it into a bacterial vector.

Transgenic Animals
Although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully
produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic animal host for
proper processing. For this reason, the desired genes are cloned and
expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. Animals
that have been modified to express recombinant DNA are called transgenic
animals. Several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic
sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens. Mice have
been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of
recombinant genes and mutations.

Transgenic Plants
Manipulating the DNA of plants (i.e., creating GMOs) has helped to create
desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide
resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life ([link]). Plants are
the most important source of food for the human population. Farmers
developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before
modern-day biotechnology practices were established.
  Corn, a major agricultural
      crop used to create
   products for a variety of
      industries, is often
   modified through plant
    biotechnology. (credit:
    Keith Weller, USDA)



Plants that have received recombinant DNA from other species are called
transgenic plants. Because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other
GMOs are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they
are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal
life. Because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment,
extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. Staples like corn,
potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically
engineered.
Transformation of Plants Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens

Gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations.
Many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by
incorporating their DNA into the human genome. In plants, tumors caused
by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens occur by transfer of DNA
from the bacterium to the plant. Although the tumors do not kill the plants,
they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental
conditions. Many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are
affected by A. tumefaciens. The artificial introduction of DNA into plant
cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell
wall.

Researchers used the natural transfer of DNA from Agrobacterium to a
plant host to introduce DNA fragments of their choice into plant hosts. In
nature, the disease-causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the
Ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the
production of tumors in plants. DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the
infected plant cell’s genome. Researchers manipulate the Ti plasmids to
remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired DNA fragment for
transfer into the plant genome. The Ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance
genes to aid selection and can be propagated in E. coli cells as well.



The Organic Insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals
during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants. Bt
toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. Insects that
have eaten Bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. After the
toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a
couple of days. Modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their
own crystal Bt toxin that acts against insects. The crystal toxin genes have
been cloned from Bt and introduced into plants. Bt toxin has been found to
be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and
is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide.
Flavr Savr Tomato

The first GM crop to be introduced into the market was the Flavr Savr
Tomato produced in 1994. Antisense RNA technology was used to slow
down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections,
which led to increased shelf life of the GM tomatoes. Additional genetic
modification improved the flavor of this tomato. The Flavr Savr tomato did
not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and
shipping the crop.

Section Summary
Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis
by breaking open the cells and enzymatically destroying all other major
macromolecules. Fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on
the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. Short stretches of DNA or RNA can
be amplified by PCR. Southern and northern blotting can be used to detect
the presence of specific short sequences in a DNA or RNA sample. The
term “cloning” may refer to cloning small DNA fragments (molecular
cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire
organisms (reproductive cloning). Genetic testing is performed to identify
disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an inheritable
disease.

Transgenic organisms possess DNA from a different species, usually
generated by molecular cloning techniques. Vaccines, antibiotics, and
hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant DNA
technology. Transgenic plants are usually created to improve characteristics
of crop plants.

Determining Evolutionary Relationships
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

     Compare homologous and analogous traits
     Discuss the purpose of cladistics
     Describe maximum parsimony

Scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make
evolutionary connections among organisms. Similar to detective work,
scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts. In the case of phylogeny,
evolutionary investigations focus on two types of evidence: morphologic
(form and function) and genetic.

Two Options for Similarities
In general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes tend
to be more closely related than those that do not. Such features that overlap
both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as
homologous structures; they stem from developmental similarities that are
based on evolution. For example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds
have homologous structures ([link]).




   Bat and bird wings are homologous structures,
   indicating that bats and birds share a common
  evolutionary past. (credit a: modification of work
       by Steve Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b:
      modification of work by U.S. DOI BLM)


Notice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones
arranged in a similar way. The more complex the feature, the more likely
any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two
people from different countries both inventing a car with all the same parts
and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared
knowledge. That outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two
people both invented a hammer, it would be reasonable to conclude that
both could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same
relationship between complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for
homologous structures in organisms.



Misleading Appearances

Some organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic
change caused a major morphological difference to make them look quite
different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but
appear very much alike. This usually happens because both organisms were
in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental
conditions. When similar characteristics occur because of environmental
constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is called an
analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and
birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different.
These are called analogous structures ([link]).

Similar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous
structures share a similar embryonic origin; analogous organs have a similar
function. For example, the bones in the front flipper of a whale are
homologous to the bones in the human arm. These structures are not
analogous. The wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bird are analogous
but not homologous. Some structures are both analogous and homologous:
the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are both homologous and
analogous. Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature
exhibits to decipher the phylogeny of the organisms being studied.




  The (c) wing of a honeybee is similar in shape to a
    (b) bird wing and (a) bat wing, and it serves the
  same function. However, the honeybee wing is not
    composed of bones and has a distinctly different
   structure and embryonic origin. These wing types
  (insect versus bat and bird) illustrate an analogy—
  similar structures that do not share an evolutionary
    history. (credit a: modification of work by Steve
     Hillebrand, USFWS; credit b: modification of
  work by U.S. DOI BLM; credit c: modification of
                  work by Jon Sullivan)

This website has several examples to show how appearances can be
misleading in understanding the phylogenetic relationships of organisms.



Molecular Comparisons

With the advancement of DNA technology, the area of molecular
systematics, which describes the use of information on the molecular level
including DNA analysis, has blossomed. New computer programs not only
confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also uncover previously
made errors. As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can
be tricky to read in some cases. For some situations, two very closely
related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation occurred that caused a
shift in the genetic code. An insertion or deletion mutation would move
each nucleotide base over one place, causing two similar codes to appear
unrelated.

Sometimes two segments of DNA code in distantly related organisms
randomly share a high percentage of bases in the same locations, causing
these organisms to appear closely related when they are not. For both of
these situations, computer technologies have been developed to help
identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of both
morphologic and molecular information is more effective in determining
phylogeny.



Note:
Evolution Connection
Why Does Phylogeny Matter?
Evolutionary biologists could list many reasons why understanding
phylogeny is important to everyday life in human society. For botanists,
phylogeny acts as a guide to discovering new plants that can be used to
benefit people. Think of all the ways humans use plants—food, medicine,
and clothing are a few examples. If a plant contains a compound that is
effective in treating cancer, scientists might want to examine all of the
relatives of that plant for other useful drugs.
A research team in China identified a segment of DNA thought to be
common to some medicinal plants in the family Fabaceae (the legume
family) and worked to identify which species had this segment ([link]).
After testing plant species in this family, the team found a DNA marker (a
known location on a chromosome that enabled them to identify the
species) present. Then, using the DNA to uncover phylogenetic
relationships, the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant
was in this family and assess its potential medicinal properties.
    Dalbergia sissoo (D. sissoo) is in
    the Fabaceae, or legume family.
     Scientists found that D. sissoo
   shares a DNA marker with species
    within the Fabaceae family that
        have antifungal properties.
       Subsequently, D. sissoo was
   shown to have fungicidal activity,
      supporting the idea that DNA
    markers can be used to screen for
     plants with potential medicinal
                properties.




Building Phylogenetic Trees
How do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? After the homologous and
analogous traits are sorted, scientists often organize the homologous traits
using a system called cladistics. This system sorts organisms into clades:
groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor. For example, in
[link], all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single
ancestor that had amniotic eggs. Consequently, all of these organisms also
have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, also called a monophyletic
group. Clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point.



Note:
Art Connection
      Lizards, rabbits, and humans all
   descend from a common ancestor that
     had an amniotic egg. Thus, lizards,
   rabbits, and humans all belong to the
    clade Amniota. Vertebrata is a larger
       clade that also includes fish and
                   lamprey.


Which animals in this figure belong to a clade that includes animals with
hair? Which evolved first, hair or the amniotic egg?



Clades can vary in size depending on which branch point is being
referenced. The important factor is that all of the organisms in the clade or
monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. This can be
remembered because monophyletic breaks down into “mono,” meaning
one, and “phyletic,” meaning evolutionary relationship. [link] shows
various examples of clades. Notice how each clade comes from a single
point, whereas the non-clade groups show branches that do not share a
single point.



Note:
Art Connection
  All the organisms within a clade stem from a
  single point on the tree. A clade may contain
    multiple groups, as in the case of animals,
  fungi and plants, or a single group, as in the
   case of flagellates. Groups that diverge at a
  different branch point, or that do not include
   all groups in a single branch point, are not
                considered clades.


What is the largest clade in this diagram?



Shared Characteristics

Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use
the phrase “descent with modification” because even though related
organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes,
changes occur. This pattern repeats over and over as one goes through the
phylogenetic tree of life:
   1. A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait
      which becomes prevalent in the group.
   2. Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait.
   3. New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist,
      leading to new traits.
   4. With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1
      and repeat).

If a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a
shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or
clade have that trait. The vertebrate in [link] is a shared ancestral character.
Now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure. Only some
of the organisms in [link] have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a
shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does
not include all of the ancestors in the tree.

The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the
fact that these terms are relative. The same trait can be considered one or
the other depending on the particular diagram being used. Returning to
[link], note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the
Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some
organisms in this group. These terms help scientists distinguish between
clades in the building of phylogenetic trees.


Choosing the Right Relationships

Imagine being the person responsible for organizing all of the items in a
department store properly—an overwhelming task. Organizing the
evolutionary relationships of all life on Earth proves much more difficult:
scientists must span enormous blocks of time and work with information
from long-extinct organisms. Trying to decipher the proper connections,
especially given the presence of homologies and analogies, makes the task
of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily difficult. Add to that the
advancement of DNA technology, which now provides large quantities of
genetic sequences to be used and analyzed. Taxonomy is a subjective
discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so
each taxonomist will decide the order of connections.

To aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately,
scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony, which means
that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way. For example, if a
group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking, based on the
principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most of the people
would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones.

For scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used: the
pathway of evolution probably includes the fewest major events that
coincide with the evidence at hand. Starting with all of the homologous
traits in a group of organisms, scientists look for the most obvious and
simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those traits.



Note:
Link to Learning




Head to this website to learn how maximum parsimony is used to create
phylogenetic trees.
These tools and concepts are only a few of the strategies scientists use to
tackle the task of revealing the evolutionary history of life on Earth.
Recently, newer technologies have uncovered surprising discoveries with
unexpected relationships, such as the fact that people seem to be more
closely related to fungi than fungi are to plants. Sound unbelievable? As
the information about DNA sequences grows, scientists will become closer
to mapping the evolutionary history of all life on Earth.
Section Summary
To build phylogenetic trees, scientists must collect accurate information that
allows them to make evolutionary connections between organisms. Using
morphologic and molecular data, scientists work to identify homologous
characteristics and genes. Similarities between organisms can stem either
from shared evolutionary history (homologies) or from separate
evolutionary paths (analogies). Newer technologies can be used to help
distinguish homologies from analogies. After homologous information is
identified, scientists use cladistics to organize these events as a means to
determine an evolutionary timeline. Scientists apply the concept of
maximum parsimony, which states that the order of events probably
occurred in the most obvious and simple way with the least amount of
steps. For evolutionary events, this would be the path with the least number
of major divergences that correlate with the evidence.

  [link] Rabbits and humans belong in the clade that includes animals
  with hair. The amniotic egg evolved before hair because the Amniota
  clade is larger than the clade that encompasses animals with hair.

  Problem:

  Why do scientists apply the concept of maximum parsimony?

      a. to decipher accurate phylogenies
      b. to eliminate analogous traits
      c. to identify mutations in DNA codes
      d. to locate homoplasies


  Solution:

  A


Free Response
Exercise:
  Problem:

  Dolphins and fish have similar body shapes. Is this feature more likely
  a homologous or analogous trait?

  Solution:

  Dolphins are mammals and fish are not, which means that their
  evolutionary paths (phylogenies) are quite separate. Dolphins probably
  adapted to have a similar body plan after returning to an aquatic
  lifestyle, and, therefore, this trait is probably analogous.
Exercise:
  Problem:

  Why is it so important for scientists to distinguish between
  homologous and analogous characteristics before building
  phylogenetic trees?

  Solution:

  Phylogenetic trees are based on evolutionary connections. If an
  analogous similarity were used on a tree, this would be erroneous and,
  furthermore, would cause the subsequent branches to be inaccurate.
Exercise:

  Problem: Describe maximum parsimony.

  Solution:

  Maximum parsimony hypothesizes that events occurred in the
  simplest, most obvious way, and the pathway of evolution probably
  includes the fewest major events that coincide with the evidence at
  hand.


Glossary
analogy
     (also, homoplasy) characteristic that is similar between organisms by
     convergent evolution, not due to the same evolutionary path

cladistics
     system used to organize homologous traits to describe phylogenies

maximum parsimony
    applying the simplest, most obvious way with the least number of
    steps
molecular systematics
    technique using molecular evidence to identify phylogenetic
    relationships

monophyletic group
   (also, clade) organisms that share a single ancestor

shared ancestral character
     describes a characteristic on a phylogenetic tree that is shared by all
     organisms on the tree

shared derived character
     describes a characteristic on a phylogenetic tree that is shared only by
