## Key Definitions

Nuclear Genome: The complete set of DNA within an organism's nucleus, measured as the C-value in base pairs or picograms.

C-value: A measurement unit quantifying total nuclear DNA content in an organism.

## Main Concepts

### DNA Content and Organism Complexity

There is a general correlation between the nuclear DNA content of a genome (i.e. the C-value) and the physical size or complexity of an organism.

Comparative data across species:
- Homo sapiens: 3,200 Mb DNA, ~25,000 genes
- E. coli: 5 Mb DNA, ~3,200 genes
- Drosophila melanogaster: 140 Mb DNA, ~13,000 genes
- Saccharomyces cerevisiae: 12 Mb DNA, ~6,000 genes

### The C-Value Paradox

Notable exceptions challenge the size-complexity correlation. Wheat genomes contain approximately 17 billion bases (roughly 5-6 times human DNA content), while marbled lungfish contain approximately 133 billion bases (~45 times human genome size).

Explanation: Much nuclear DNA doesn't encode genes. Non-coding DNA includes transposable elements and highly repetitive sequences that separate genes across larger genomes.

### Additional Genomes

Mitochondria and chloroplasts possess their own relatively small, circular genomes—structurally similar to prokaryotic DNA, supporting the endosymbiont hypothesis regarding organellar origins.
